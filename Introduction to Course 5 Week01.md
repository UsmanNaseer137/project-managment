## Introduction to Course 5

## WaterFall Vs Agile
1. Waterfall is a popular project management methodology that refers to the sequential or linear ordering of phases. 
2. The term "agile" refers to being able to move quickly and easily.
3. It also refers to flexibility and the willingness and ability to change and adapt.
4. Projects that adopt an Agile project management take an iterative approach.
5. which means the project processes are repeated often many times during the life cycle of the project. 
6. WaterFall have huge number of documentation But in Agile, there's an emphasis on real- time, person-to-person conversations.
7.  In Waterfall projects, you often don't release the deliverable until the very end. Agile is just as exciting, but has smaller more frequent releases. 

## Iterations 
1. In this case, the team operates within many shorter blocks of time, called iterations.
2.  Individual iterations might get repeated depending on the feedback received. 
3.  During each iteration, the team takes a subset of all the project's activities and does all the work required to complete that subset of activities.
4.  This iterative approach enables the project to move quickly, as well as making it much more adaptive to change.

## Agile
Flexibility, repetition, and openness to change

## Agile Project Managment
Agile project management is an approach to project and team management based on the Agile Manifesto. 

## Manifesto
The manifesto is a collection of four values and 12 principles that define the mindset that all Agile teams should strive for.

## History of agile
![HistoryOfAgile](https://github.com/abdullahbannuwala/project-managment/blob/main/github%20history01.PNG)
1. Agile has been so successful in the software industry that its values, principles, and frameworks have been applied to nearly every industry.
2. In fact, the Agile methods that you're going to learn also draw heavily on Lean manufacturing principles that originated in Toyota's car factories in the 1930s. 

## Distinguishing Agile from Waterfall
1. Agile was created in response to the strict linear process of Waterfall. 
2. While Waterfall aims for predictability and tries to avoid change
3. Agile embraces the reality that the world, markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.
4. For example, your customer might say they want feature A, but when the final result is delivered, they realize they actually wanted feature B.
5. Agile aims to solve that problem by getting customer feedback more quickly to make sure that the team is building what the customer really wants. 
6. Part of working with an Agile mindset is always seeking out ways to work more efficiently.  We do this by finding ways to streamline processes without reducing product quality or value. 
7. The key to streamlining is to reduce waste.
8. In Agile, requirements are treated as more dynamic and expected to change as the team receives feedback and new information. 

## Aspects of a project
1. Requirements : Requirements are conditions that must be met or tasks that must be finished to ensure the successful completion of the project.
2. Documentatoin : All projects require documentation, project plans, stakeholder maps, schedules, charters, contracts—the list goes on and on. 
3. Deliverables
## Deliverable
A deliverable is a tangible outcome from a project. 
![HistoryOfAgile](https://github.com/abdullahbannuwala/project-managment/blob/main/github%20history02.PNG)

## The four values of the Agile Manifesto
1. The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 and brings together the collective wisdom of the people who developed it from their vast experience and thought leadership in the tech industry.
2. From the four values, a set of 12 principles were developed that reinforced the message of the Manifesto. 
3. These values and principles inform the why, how, and what of Agile project management planning and processes.

![HistoryOfAgile](https://github.com/abdullahbannuwala/project-managment/blob/main/menifesto2.PNG)

## Individual & Interactions Over Processes & Tools
1. First, the Manifesto emphasizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. At its core, this value stresses people communicating with each other over using lots of processes and tools to force things to happen in a certain way.
3. Agile Work togather & collaboration & help each other & Agile also values individual perspectives and creativity. 

## Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
1. The second value emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, meaning that teams should prioritize spending time working on things that actually create value and avoid spending any more time than they really need on debating, writing, and reviewing documents. 
2. Working on things that create value.

## Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
1. On to the third value: customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
2. In Agile projects, the customer's satisfaction is considered the highest priority.
3. Collaboration with customers early and often.
4. React & Adapt the feedback.

## Responding to change over following a plan.
1. Change are inevitable.

## The 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto
![HistoryOfAgile](https://github.com/abdullahbannuwala/project-managment/blob/main/agilevalues.PNG)

## Value Delivery  : Delivery the work quickly to get the feedback & mitigate time risk.
1. Satisfy customer by early & continous delivery of valueble software.
2. Deliver working software/Deliverable/Solutions frequently.
3. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
4. Simplicity allows a team to work on the things that matter most.
5. Team only works on approved features and doesn't spend time on unnecessary ones. 
6. Another example might be reserving ten percent of the team's time to work on bug fixing or polishing a process, which should help you go faster in future iterations. 

## Business Collaboration : Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information immediately by allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information instantly.
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for customer's competitive advantage.
2. Business people & developer must work together daily thoughout the project.
3. You can achieve collaboration by making sure that business people work near the development team, ideally in the same office or virtual space.


## Team Dynamic & Cultuer : Individual & Interactions Over Processes & Tools
1. Build project around the motivated individuals , give enviormnet , support trust.
2. The most effective way of converying information is face to face conversation.
3. Agile promote sustanable enviroment . The sponsor , developers, users should be able to maintain a contant pace indefinitly.
4. The best architecture, requirement and desgin emerge from self-organizing teams.

## Example
An example of emphasizing effective team culture would be to ask the team what kind of equipment they need to do their job and then giving them those tools.

## Make sure you team 
1. Motivated to do the right things.
2. Feel trusted to do the right things.
3. Has the resources & space to work closely togather on their goals.
4. Work at a sustainable pace.

## Retrospective & Continous Learning
1. At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
2.  This one sits on its own because I want to draw attention to how important it is for Agile teams to continuously learn and adapt to what's working and what's not working for them. 

## Questions:
1. How is the team doing?
2. Are the customer happy?
3. Are there processes we could optimize ? Are tools working for us.?
4. Are we following the value?
5. Are we accumulating any debt, technical or otherwise?

## Adopting an Agile mindset

## Agile 
1. Agile is about delivering value in a world with high degrees of uncertainty, risk, and competition.
2. Agile works best in industries or projects that are susceptible to or that encourage change and uncertainty.
3. Bio, Media, Food , Fashion

## VUCA
1. That concept is called VUCA, and it can help you decide which project management approach is best for you. The US military War College developed a concept called VUCA, spelled V-U-C-A. VUCA is an acronym (short form) that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.
2. It's a concept that was developed to deal with these forces in a changing and uncertain world. 
3. Businesses can apply the concept of VUCA as a tool for determining how best to approach projects. 


V = Volatility  U= Uncertainty  C= Complexity A= Ambiguity

## Volatility
Volatility refers to the rate of change and churn (Urdu : Ghumana ) in a business or situation. 

## Uncertainty
Uncertainty refers to the lack of predictability or high potential for surprise.

## Complexity
 Complexity refers to the high number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project.
 
 ## Ambiguity
  Ambiguity refers to the possibility of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances

## Applying Agile in a VUCA environment
1. When we get started on a new project, it's helpful to examine the environment and conditions in which the project exists before we decide the best approach to use. 
2. If your project environment has high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, then it's a good sign that you should consider an Agile approach. 
3. While an Agile approach is not a perfect solution that will get rid of VUCA, it will lead to better outcomes by giving you and your team tools and systems to mitigate the risks that VUCA presents.

## Introduction to Scrum
1. Scrum refers to a formation in rugby where all of the players on the team lean forward, lock their heads together, and then work as one unit to try and gain precious yards towards the scoring line. 
2. If you work in Agile project management, it's highly likely that you'll use Scrum or an approach that is based on Scrum.
3. In the 2019 State of Agile report, 72% of teams using Agile methods were using Scrum or a hybrid.
4. When you use Scrum for project management, you form a team that will work together to quickly develop and test a deliverable. 
5. The work is completed in short cycles, and the team meets daily to discuss current tasks and clear up anything that's blocking their progress.

## Backlog
1. The Backlog is the central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on. 
2. It's prioritized and proactively managed by the team continuously throughout the life of the project.

## Scrum
1. The Sprint is the name of the time-boxed period in Scrum where work is done. 
2. This Sprint can be between one and four weeks long, but most Sprints are around two weeks. This is often called the "iteration."

## Daily Scrum
Daily Scrum, also called the Stand-up. This is where the team meets for 15 minutes or less every day of the Sprint to inspect their progress toward their goal.

## Scrum Master
1. This role is responsible for ensuring that the team lives Agile values and principles
2. follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to
3. sharing information to the larger project team
4. and they also help the team focus on doing their best work.
 
 ## Product Owner
 1. The other notable role in Scrum is the Product Owner, who is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the team.
 2. The Product Owner owns the inventory of work and has the final say on how to prioritize the work. 

## Development Team
1. Development Team is responsible for how a team will deliver that product.

## Reasons for scrum popularity
1. First, it has clear roles and responsibilities for the folks on the team while continuously emphasizing the power of the team as a whole. 
2. Scrum has very regular and predictable meetings and delivery schedules with predefined agendas and outcomes for the meetings, making it easy to teach new team members.
4. It supports and reinforces the Agile values and principles while adding some structure and foundations that help new Agile teams get started and more experienced teams get better, and it's all free and open for all to use. 
5. It's all free and open for all to use. Since it's the most commonly-used Agile delivery framework, there's also a huge amount of guidance and support online, as well as Scrum-specific training and certifications. 

## Scrum Team Member
1. Some call this a "pizza-size team" because it has the same amount of people who could share a large pizza.
2. Scrum lends itself best to the following types of projects and teams. Ideally, a Scrum team should be cross-functional, with around three to nine team members. 
3. If the team is too small, you might not have the diversity of skills to get work done. 
4. If the team is too large, it gets hard to distribute information. 
5. Lastly, Scrum works best for projects where the team and management are open-minded, adaptable, and value continuously learning how to be a better team. 

## READING
The founding principles of Scrum
In this reading, you will learn to define the characteristics of Scrum as we review what makes Scrum different from other frameworks.

Although Scrum was first used to describe Agile content in 1986 in the Harvard Business Review, the term originates from the internationally loved sport, rugby. In rugby, a “scrum” involves players huddling closely together with their heads down while trying to gain possession of the ball. Then, the players work together in order to achieve their shared goal: to get the ball across the line and score!

Image of a rugby team
The original Harvard Business Review paper, written by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiri Nonaka and titled The New New Product Development Game, introduces Scrum in the chapter “Moving the Scrum downfield.” Throughout the paper, the authors continue to point out which characteristics of a team help to move the Scrum downfield. Those are: 

Built-in instability: In the Scrum world, teams are given the freedom to achieve important outcomes with “challenging requirements.” Takeuchi and Nonaka explain that this gives teams “an element of tension” necessary to “carry out a project of strategic importance to the company.” 

Self-organizing teams: Scrum Teams were intended to operate like their own start-up, with a unique order that lacks true hierarchy. These teams are considered self-organizing when they exhibit autonomy, continuous growth, and collaboration.  

Overlapping development phases: Individuals on a Scrum Team must “work toward synchronizing their pace to meet deadlines.” At some point throughout the process, each individual’s pace starts to overlap with others, and eventually, a collective pace is formed within the team.

Multi-learning: Scrum is a framework that relies heavily on trial and error. Scrum Team members also aim to stay up-to-date with changing market conditions and can then respond quickly to those conditions. 

Subtle control: As we mentioned, Scrum Teams are self-organizing and operate like a start-up, but that doesn’t mean there is no structure at all. By creating checkpoints throughout the project to analyze team interactions and progress, Scrum Teams maintain control without hindering creativity. 

Organizational transfer of learning: On Scrum Teams, everyone is encouraged to learn skills that may be new to them as they support other team members. 

The authors’ main point was that “each element, by itself, does not bring about speed and flexibility. But taken as a whole, the characteristics can produce a powerful new set of dynamics that will make a difference.” Though these concepts were first introduced in 1986, they still remain remarkably true for Scrum Teams today. 


## Introduction to Kanban, XP, and Lean
![agileumbrla](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/160614789-ec3ad111-15e3-423f-972f-2adcafecbcb9.PNG)

## Kanban
1. Japanese work
2. Kan = Sign  , Ban = Board
3. Provides transparent visual feedback.
4. Kanban boards or charts display the progress of a project as to do in progress and done.
5. The Kanban method ensures that the project team only accepts a sustainable (Doable)  amount of in progress work. 
6. This means the amount of in progress tasks are limited to what the team can actually handle during a certain amount of time. 
7. This is called the work-in- progress limit, or WIP limit. The WIP limit is decided on by the team. 
8. WIP limit : Tasks are limited to what the team can actually handle during  a certain amount of time.
9. The team members add new tasks to be completed only after they finished their previous task and are below the WIP limit. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/160616312-29a99672-7ee3-4bc8-8758-a0d6811758c6.png)

## Flow
This goal of trying to maximize efficiency is called flow, and is a core principle of Kanban.

## Extreme Programming or XP
1. The XP methodology aims to improve product quality and the ability to respond to changing customer needs. 
2.  It does this by taking best practices for the development process to extreme levels. 

## XP Activities
## Designing
1. XP wants to ensure that all of the pieces of the product will fit together properly.

## Coding: 
1. Code is the language that's used to write software programs.
2. XP demands clear and concise code, so that others can easily read and understand the program. 

## Testing
1. Testing: like I described earlier means checking the product for flaws so they don't end up in the final product. In XP, more is better. 
2. The goal is to test for and eliminate any flaws in a feature before building it and continuing on. 

## Listen
1. Testing also means checking to make sure the product features, meet the customer's requirements. 
2. Which leads us to listening. Which is about listening to the customer and ensuring that the requirements are integrated into the product. 

## XP innovative programming
1. Pair Programming
2. Continuous integration and continuous refactoring. CI/CD
3. Avoid big design up front. This relates to designing and means the design should be just enough to get started and should be continuously improved as the product evolves.
4. Write tests, not requirements.

## Lean
1. In the context of Lean 6 Sigma. Lean methodology consists of five principles that serve as a recipe for improving project outcomes. 

## 5 Principles of Lean
1. Define Value : Define value means identifying and focusing on what the customer wants and including the customer in the process. 
2. Map Value Stream : Mapping out the process or stream, including all the steps involved in producing value for the customer.
3. Create Flow : Ensuring the product flows through the value stream efficiently, continuing to eliminate waste throughout the cycle.
4. Establish Pull : Make sure the customer is pulling on the product or asking for it throughout the value stream. They might pull or ask for features and incremental deliveries. 
5. Pursue Perfection : pushing your team to continuously improve the first four process steps. 

## Blending project management approaches
1. First, we explored Agile as a way of thinking about the project-delivery process through the values and principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto.
2. we explored Agile through different project delivery frameworks and methods like Kanban, XP, and Lean, and especially through Scrum. 
3. The the real power of Agile comes from not only adopting certain processes or strategies but also from adopting a certain kind of mindset—one that is necessarily different from the traditional Waterfall models. 
4. Waterfall project life cycle is made up of the following phases: initiation, planning, executing and completing tasks, and closing out the project

## Reason to blend (Mix) waterfall and agile styles
1. Your stakeholders, customers, or sponsors are more comfortable with traditional approaches and using workflows, or delivering traditional work products is easier for them to understand and follow, but your project team is already established in Scrum and they wish to continue.
2. Regulatory requirements that insist on certain traditional work processes.
3. Vendors involved in a large project is already following a traditional approach and the integration between the teams require some blending of methods. 

## The Spotify model
Because of their flexible approach, Spotify—a music streaming company with millions of listeners—is known in the Agile project management field for setting the standard pretty high. In this reading, you will learn about the Spotify model and the importance of being flexible when scaling an Agile team. 

Spotify has been able to do what so many other companies dream of doing, and they’ve done it as their team size scaled. How did they do it? Agile coaches Henrik Kniberg and Anders Ivarsson have instilled an overall approach of the constant blending of methods and adapting as time goes on. 

## The Spotify model
The Spotify model encourages innovation, collaboration, and productivity while maintaining autonomy, quality, and necessary communication. It does so by using a unique organization system that features Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds.

At Spotify, teams are broken down into what they call Squads. A Squad is like a Scrum Team and is supposed to feel like its own start-up within the company. Squads are self-organizing and collocated. They work together to achieve a long-term mission. At Spotify, a Squad may be in charge of a task such as improving the app’s usability for Android, improving the Spotify radio experience, or providing payment solutions. Just like a Scrum Team, the Squad doesn't have a formal leader, but they do have a Product Owner. Product Owners collaborate with one another to maintain a roadmap to track Spotify’s progress as a whole. Each team also has access to an Agile coach to encourage continuous improvements.
![spotifymodel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/161373704-d4ef34ab-a5c3-4ce5-869c-6276c8fc9538.PNG)

## Be inspired by the Spotify model, but don’t emulate it
Each team requires differences in their workflow and systems. It is never a good idea to try to copy and paste an exact model to your team just because it worked for another team. In fact, some people have tried copying Spotify’s model and found that it was not a suitable model for their team at all.

## Key takeaways 
You must always be able to adapt based on your team’s preferences and goals. The Spotify team started in Squads, but as they scaled, they added new types of groups within the organization—without disrupting the existing Squads. They continued to do so until they found the perfect balance of collaboration and ownership. 

Always examine the needs of your project and organization. What works for Spotify may not be an exact fit for your team. If you are on a team that needs scaling, be inspired by this model, but use the aspects that work best for your organization. 

Don’t be afraid of trial and error. If you try something and it doesn’t feel quite right, you can easily adjust.

You should never consider yourself done improving. There are always changes that can be made for the better.
