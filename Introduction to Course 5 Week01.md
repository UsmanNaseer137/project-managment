## Introduction to Course 5

## WaterFall Vs Agile
1. Waterfall is a popular project management methodology that refers to the sequential or linear ordering of phases. 
2. The term "agile" refers to being able to move quickly and easily.
3. It also refers to flexibility and the willingness and ability to change and adapt.
4. Projects that adopt an Agile project management take an iterative approach.
5. which means the project processes are repeated often many times during the life cycle of the project. 
6. WaterFall have huge number of documentation But in Agile, there's an emphasis on real- time, person-to-person conversations.
7.  In Waterfall projects, you often don't release the deliverable until the very end. Agile is just as exciting, but has smaller more frequent releases. 

## Iterations 
1. In this case, the team operates within many shorter blocks of time, called iterations.
2.  Individual iterations might get repeated depending on the feedback received. 
3.  During each iteration, the team takes a subset of all the project's activities and does all the work required to complete that subset of activities.
4.  This iterative approach enables the project to move quickly, as well as making it much more adaptive to change.

## Agile
Flexibility, repetition, and openness to change

## Agile Project Managment
Agile project management is an approach to project and team management based on the Agile Manifesto. 

## Manifesto
The manifesto is a collection of four values and 12 principles that define the mindset that all Agile teams should strive for.

## History of agile

1. Agile has been so successful in the software industry that its values, principles, and frameworks have been applied to nearly every industry.
2. In fact, the Agile methods that you're going to learn also draw heavily on Lean manufacturing principles that originated in Toyota's car factories in the 1930s. 

## Distinguishing Agile from Waterfall
1. Agile was created in response to the strict linear process of Waterfall. 
2. While Waterfall aims for predictability and tries to avoid change
3. Agile embraces the reality that the world, markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.
4. For example, your customer might say they want feature A, but when the final result is delivered, they realize they actually wanted feature B.
5. Agile aims to solve that problem by getting customer feedback more quickly to make sure that the team is building what the customer really wants. 
6. Part of working with an Agile mindset is always seeking out ways to work more efficiently.  We do this by finding ways to streamline processes without reducing product quality or value. 
7. The key to streamlining is to reduce waste.
8. In Agile, requirements are treated as more dynamic and expected to change as the team receives feedback and new information. 

## Aspects of a project
1. Requirements : Requirements are conditions that must be met or tasks that must be finished to ensure the successful completion of the project.
2. Documentatoin : All projects require documentation, project plans, stakeholder maps, schedules, charters, contractsâ€”the list goes on and on. 
3. Deliverables
## Deliverable
A deliverable is a tangible outcome from a project.

## The four values of the Agile Manifesto
1. The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 and brings together the collective wisdom of the people who developed it from their vast experience and thought leadership in the tech industry.
2. From the four values, a set of 12 principles were developed that reinforced the message of the Manifesto. 
3. These values and principles inform the why, how, and what of Agile project management planning and processes.

## Individual & Interactions Over Processes & Tools
1. First, the Manifesto emphasizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. At its core, this value stresses people communicating with each other over using lots of processes and tools to force things to happen in a certain way.
3. Agile Work togather & collaboration & help each other & Agile also values individual perspectives and creativity. 

## Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
1. The second value emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, meaning that teams should prioritize spending time working on things that actually create value and avoid spending any more time than they really need on debating, writing, and reviewing documents. 
2. Working on things that create value.

## Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
1. On to the third value: customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
2. In Agile projects, the customer's satisfaction is considered the highest priority.
3. Collaboration with customers early and often.
4. React & Adapt the feedback.

## Responding to change over following a plan.
1. Change are inevitable.

## The 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto

## Value Delivery  : Delivery the work quickly to get the feedback & mitigate time risk.
1. Satisfy customer by early & continous delivery of valueble software.
2. Deliver working software/Deliverable/Solutions frequently.
3. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
4. Simplicity allows a team to work on the things that matter most.
5. Team only works on approved features and doesn't spend time on unnecessary ones. 
6. Another example might be reserving ten percent of the team's time to work on bug fixing or polishing a process, which should help you go faster in future iterations. 

## Business Collaboration : Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information immediately by allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information instantly.
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for customer's competitive advantage.
2. Business people & developer must work together daily thoughout the project.
3. You can achieve collaboration by making sure that business people work near the development team, ideally in the same office or virtual space.


## Team Dynamic & Cultuer
1. Build project around the motivated individuals , give enviormnet , support trust.
2. The most effective way of converying information is face to face conversation.
3. Agile promote sustanable enviroment . The sponsor , developers, users should be able to maintain a contant pace indefinitly.
4. The best architecture, requirement and desgin emerge from self-organizing teams.
