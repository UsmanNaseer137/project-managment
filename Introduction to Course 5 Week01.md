## History of agile
## WaterFall Vs Agile
1. Waterfall is a popular project management methodology that refers to the sequential or linear ordering of phases. 
2. The term "agile" refers to being able to move quickly and easily.
3. It also refers to flexibility and the willingness and ability to change and adapt.
4. Projects that adopt an Agile project management take an iterative approach.
5. which means the project processes are repeated often many times during the life cycle of the project. 

## Iterations 
1. In this case, the team operates within many shorter blocks of time, called iterations.
2.  Individual iterations might get repeated depending on the feedback received. 
3.  During each iteration, the team takes a subset of all the project's activities and does all the work required to complete that subset of activities.
4.  This iterative approach enables the project to move quickly, as well as making it much more adaptive to change.

2. In fact, the Agile methods that you're going to learn also draw heavily on Lean manufacturing principles that originated in Toyota's car factories in the 1930s. 

## Distinguishing Agile from Waterfall
1. Agile was created in response to the strict linear process of Waterfall. 
2. While Waterfall aims for predictability and tries to avoid change
3. Agile embraces the reality that the world, markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.
