## Introduction: Scrum 101

## Scrum Guide
The Scrum Guide, which contains everything you need to know about Scrum, is a main source of truth for Scrum Teams and is available for free at Scrumguides.org.

## Scrum Vs Agile
 To make this really clear, Agile is the foundational philosophy and mindset, while Scrum is a framework that materializes or brings that philosophy to life. 
 
 ## Scrum Theory
 1. 3 Pillars
 2. 5 Values

## The three pillars of Scrum

## Scrum
Scrum as a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.
## Iterative
Iterative refers to the fact that project processes are repeated.
## Incremental
Incremental refers to the work being divided into smaller chunks that build on each other. 
## empiricism
Scrum is founded on a scientific theory called empiricism. This is a fancy word for a simple concept: that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience. 

## Scrum Pillars
1. Transparency : 
   Transparency means that we make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcome.
   Transparency inside a Scrum Team is critical to the team's productivity and the project's completion.
2. Inspection : 
   Inspection refers to conducting timely checks towards the outcome of a Sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.
   The more inspections that take place, the more improvement a team experiences in their work.  
3. Adaptation
   Adaptation means that we're continuously searching for ways to adjust our project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation or issues.
   Although adaptation includes immediate fixes to problems, it may also be about implementing a change so future projects don't repeat past mistakes.

## The five values of Scrum
## Commitment
1. This means personally committing to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. 
Example :
For example, maybe a member of the team is struggling to overcome something that is blocking their work from getting done, like a new technology that is proving difficult to learn. In this case, another team member who is familiar with the technology can put their own work aside to step in and help their teammate learn the technology.

## Courage
1. Scrum Team members must have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems. 
2. An example of courage includes taking on a hard task that you know will require you to learn a new skill. 

## Focus
1. This refers to everyone focusing on the necessary work within the Sprint and the overall goals of the Scrum Team.
2. For example, a team member is working on a solution that involves a new technology and is very difficult.  Allowing that team member to focus on that difficult yet necessary part of the solution is key, and their teammates help get it across the finish line. They know that focusing on the solution will speed up the team's progress in the long run, so it's worth the investment now.

## Openess
1. For Scrum to work, the team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the various challenges that come with performing the work. 

## Respect
1. Team members should respect the opinions, skills, and independence of their teammates.

## Note :
In order for a team to bring the three pillars of Scrum to life, they must act in accordance with the five Scrum values.
