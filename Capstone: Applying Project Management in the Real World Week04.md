## Introduction: Effective stakeholder communication

## Communicating project problems

1. Every project has its problems, and communicating those problems is a part of your job as a project manager.
2. Usually project problems are small enough to address within the immediate project team
3. But occasionally you'll need to escalate problems and propose solutions to a senior stakeholder for their input and guidance on next steps.
4. Instead, it's your responsibility as a project manager to synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent summary that clearly communicates the issue.

## Synthesizing (combine + Arrange)
Synthesizing requires gathering information from multiple sources and using those points to help form your own analysis. 

## Example
You've been working on creating a few solutions to mitigate this issue. Rather than sending your stakeholders a link to the plan and pointing out all of the overdue tasks, you might summarize the problem by telling them a number of tasks have run past their due date because of supplier issues. So we recommend hiring a second supplier to hit the deliverable date. 

## Expert 
Problem solving is quintessentially (representing the most perfect  ) the most important thing we do as program managers. It is the job.

## Connecting project problems to goals

## OKR
1. Objectives and Key Results are a tool for organization-wide goal setting. 
2. OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.
3. O : The objectives portion of the OKR defines what needs to be achieved, which is similar to a goal. 
4. Example : For example, one of Sauce &amp; Spoon's objectives might be to prioritize customer needs and wants.
5. KR : The key results portion of the OKR defines how an organization, team, or individual will tangibly measure their success in meeting the objective. 
6. Example : The key result that indicates they've reached this objective could be addressing feedback from customer reviews within 24 hours.


7. Earlier in this course, you learned that OKRs can be a helpful reference point when determining if a project goal is relevant to the needs of an organization. 
8. OKRs can be a kind of shared language for an organization. 
9. OKRs can be really helpful to reference when communicating with stakeholders about project problems.

## Writing emails to escalate a problem
1. Email can be an effective tool for quickly escalating a problem and asking for a decision from a stakeholder on how to proceed.
2. First, think about what's most important to your stakeholder. 
3. Identify how a problem will impact your organization as a whole, and ensure that you clearly communicate that impact within the first two sentences of your email. 
4. Remember to write a clear subject line that briefly states what your email is about.
5. It's also helpful to include language in your subject line that indicates what you'd like your stakeholder to do upon reading your email.
6. Remember to also keep the body of the email brief and to the point.
7.  If there are documents or additional information that your stakeholder might need to review to make an informed decision, consider including hyperlinks or attachments with the information in your email. 

## Expert 
1.  It's important to remember that while you have multiple stakeholders or different projects, it is going to be different how each of them like to communicate or like to receive information.

2. Another good tip is when you come to a stakeholder with a problem or an issue, you also come with your proposed solution or possible solutions, thinking about not just asking, what do I do? But saying, I think maybe we should do A, but we could also do B and C.

3.  If you're sending an update via email, you really want to make sure, just like a meeting, that you're using the email in the best way possible. Something I like to do and that we do often at Google is called TLDR at the top, which means too long didn't read.

4. When you're communicating with a stakeholder, you really want to think about the absolute important information that they need to see.

## Completing a closeout report

## Closeout report
The closeout report is a great opportunity to compile all links and documentation into one place, a practice we like to call: good project hygiene. 

1. A closeout report confirms the project is done
2. Summarizes deliverables, success metrics
3. Feedback
4. Lessons learned and next steps
5. Serves as a reference document for the organization.

If a follow up project is required or a similar project is initiated, having these artifacts in one place will help these future projects run smoothly and should another similar project occur, future project managers will be set up for success if they have meticulous information on past projects.

## An effective closeout report
1. An effective closeout report helps ensure that everyone is satisfied with the work that was done
2. Finalizes the efforts of the team and lets people move on to new projects and tasks
3. Increases the impact of the team's work through communication with other people who may not have been as involved in the project. 

Ideally, you want anyone unfamiliar with the project to be able to read it and get a full understanding of what the project was, why it was done and how well the project went.

## Closeout Report Contents
1. Project Summary -- objective
2. Methodology  --Agile / WaterFall
3. Performace Baseline --Actual project schedule, cost, delivered scope Vs Planned schedule, cost, delivered scope
4. Key Accomplishments
5. Lessone Learned
6. Next Step  --any on-going maintenance or development
7. Project Documentation Archive  -- All project doc links

## Project impact report
1. The purpose of creating an impact report is to show others the value that's been added to your project. 
2.  Usually it's in the form of a presentation guided by a deck or slideshow you've created.

## Reporting your project impact is key for a few reasons. 
1. It can help you to analyze results to adapt and improve services. 
2. Motivate staff and senior stakeholders by celebrating achievements. 
3. Build trust and credibility with supporters, sponsors, funders, and anyone benefiting from the project. 
4. Share lessons with similar organizations. 

## Executive summary
1. An executive summary is a few sentences to a paragraph that describe the project's purpose and outcome.
2. It provides an overview of the main points of a larger report. It's written to share with the stakeholders who might not have time to review the entire report.


Your executive summary should aim to answer questions like:
1. How effectively was the project delivered and what did we learn from it? 
2. In addition to asking yourself some foundational questions, 
3. It's a good idea to review your smart goals, your business case
4. Your project charter to help you write the executive summary. 


## You'll want to include elements of the following information: 
1. project vision.  -- Here you'll specify what the purpose of your report was. What need is the project fulfilling? 
2. Key accomplishments. -- This is your opportunity to discuss which activities, tasks, and milestones helped you to find success.
3. Lessons learned.   --This is where you'll talk about potential improvements.

## elevator pitc  -- tell me about your self
1. An elevator pitch is a quick professional summary of yourself, typically, it's designed for you to present in 60 seconds or less. 
2. An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech about an idea, product, company, or individual (like you). You should be able to deliver your elevator pitch in the amount of time it takes to ride an elevator with someone from one floor to another. An elevator pitch is typically 30-60 seconds long, or approximately 75-150 words. 

2. To create a strong elevator pitch, you need to consider how to present yourself as a potential candidate for a specific role. Before you begin writing the pitch itself, you will identify and highlight the key information you want to share. Then, you will write a 30-60-second pitch. 
 
 To craft a strong elevator pitch, break it down into three parts:
 1. Who you are
 2. what skills and experiences you have
 3. What you want  --  This part of the pitch is unique to this setting and the person you're pitching to.

Example 
 I started my career in project management a few years ago. And recently, I've been drawn to the gaming space. I've always been good at bringing people together and working towards common goals. My experience successfully leading teams and managing new app development, led me to look for opportunities in the industry. 
 
 
 ## The SMART METHOD
 
 ##  Behavioral questions
 Behavioral questions are those that allow the interviewee to share an example when they had to practice a particular skill. 
 
 ## Hypothetical questions
 Interviewers that ask hypothetical questions would typically present a scenario to you and then ask you how you'd go about working through that experience. 
 
 ##  Factual questions
 Factual questions aim to assess you on your knowledge of basic project management skills.
 
 ## STAR
 It's important that you provide clear responses to your interviewer. So we recommend the STAR method. STAR stands for situation, task, action, and result. It's a great way to organize your response, following a story-like structure.
 
 ## Situation
First, you begin with a situation. For example, if your interviewer asked you, "Tell me about a time when you had a project deliverable that was not going to meet high-quality expectations. What did you do?" Using the STAR method, you'll want to explain the situation in the experience you'll be using to answer their question.
  
  ## Task
What was the task or your involvement or responsibility in the scenario? What deliverable were you assigned to complete? What was the quality you are aiming for? Next, you'll provide more detail.

## Action
What action or actions did you take? This is where you really want to highlight your contributions. When did you realize your deliverable was not meeting the quality standards you were aiming for? What was your reaction to this? What decisions did you make to course correct? Who did you partner with, and how did you communicate this to your manager or team? This part of your response may take up the most time to cover as you can highlight multiple skills here, but make sure to keep a clear and structured response. 

## Response
 The final part of your response, should be focused on the result. Here, you should discuss the outcome from the decisions you made and the impact you had.
