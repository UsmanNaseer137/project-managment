## Introduction: Effective stakeholder communication

## Communicating project problems

1. Every project has its problems, and communicating those problems is a part of your job as a project manager.
2. Usually project problems are small enough to address within the immediate project team
3. But occasionally you'll need to escalate problems and propose solutions to a senior stakeholder for their input and guidance on next steps.
4. Instead, it's your responsibility as a project manager to synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent summary that clearly communicates the issue.

## Synthesizing (combine + Arrange)
Synthesizing requires gathering information from multiple sources and using those points to help form your own analysis. 

## Example
You've been working on creating a few solutions to mitigate this issue. Rather than sending your stakeholders a link to the plan and pointing out all of the overdue tasks, you might summarize the problem by telling them a number of tasks have run past their due date because of supplier issues. So we recommend hiring a second supplier to hit the deliverable date. 

## Expert 
Problem solving is quintessentially (representing the most perfect  ) the most important thing we do as program managers. It is the job.

## Connecting project problems to goals

## OKR
1. Objectives and Key Results are a tool for organization-wide goal setting. 
2. OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.
3. O : The objectives portion of the OKR defines what needs to be achieved, which is similar to a goal. 
4. Example : For example, one of Sauce &amp; Spoon's objectives might be to prioritize customer needs and wants.
5. KR : The key results portion of the OKR defines how an organization, team, or individual will tangibly measure their success in meeting the objective. 
6. Example : The key result that indicates they've reached this objective could be addressing feedback from customer reviews within 24 hours.


7. Earlier in this course, you learned that OKRs can be a helpful reference point when determining if a project goal is relevant to the needs of an organization. 
8. OKRs can be a kind of shared language for an organization. 
9. OKRs can be really helpful to reference when communicating with stakeholders about project problems.

## Writing emails to escalate a problem
1. Email can be an effective tool for quickly escalating a problem and asking for a decision from a stakeholder on how to proceed.
2. First, think about what's most important to your stakeholder. 
3. Identify how a problem will impact your organization as a whole, and ensure that you clearly communicate that impact within the first two sentences of your email. 
4. Remember to write a clear subject line that briefly states what your email is about.
5. It's also helpful to include language in your subject line that indicates what you'd like your stakeholder to do upon reading your email.
6. Remember to also keep the body of the email brief and to the point.
7.  If there are documents or additional information that your stakeholder might need to review to make an informed decision, consider including hyperlinks or attachments with the information in your email. 

## Expert 
1.  It's important to remember that while you have multiple stakeholders or different projects, it is going to be different how each of them like to communicate or like to receive information.

2. Another good tip is when you come to a stakeholder with a problem or an issue, you also come with your proposed solution or possible solutions, thinking about not just asking, what do I do? But saying, I think maybe we should do A, but we could also do B and C.

3.  If you're sending an update via email, you really want to make sure, just like a meeting, that you're using the email in the best way possible. Something I like to do and that we do often at Google is called TLDR at the top, which means too long didn't read.

4. When you're communicating with a stakeholder, you really want to think about the absolute important information that they need to see.
