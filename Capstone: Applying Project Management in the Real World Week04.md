## Introduction: Effective stakeholder communication

## Communicating project problems

1. Every project has its problems, and communicating those problems is a part of your job as a project manager.
2. Usually project problems are small enough to address within the immediate project team
3. But occasionally you'll need to escalate problems and propose solutions to a senior stakeholder for their input and guidance on next steps.
4. Instead, it's your responsibility as a project manager to synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent summary that clearly communicates the issue.

## Synthesizing (combine + Arrange)
Synthesizing requires gathering information from multiple sources and using those points to help form your own analysis. 

## Example
You've been working on creating a few solutions to mitigate this issue. Rather than sending your stakeholders a link to the plan and pointing out all of the overdue tasks, you might summarize the problem by telling them a number of tasks have run past their due date because of supplier issues. So we recommend hiring a second supplier to hit the deliverable date.
