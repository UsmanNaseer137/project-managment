## Project charters: Purpose and components
You'll analyze project documents and supporting materials to identify project requirements, evaluate stakeholders, and problem solve. 

Strategic thinking involves analyzing documentation and talking with stakeholders to inform decisions based on the information available to you. 

A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach the project's goals. The project manager creates the charter during the initiation phase, which is the first phase of the project life cycle. 

The project charter helps you organize vital project information, create a framework for the work that needs to be done, and communicate those details to the necessary people. 

It's also useful as a reference throughout the project's life cycle, since it can help stakeholders realign on the project scope, goals, and costs.

The project charter contains key information about a project, like the summary, goals, and deliverables. The goal of the summary is to provide an overview of the project and to outline the goals you hope to accomplish.


Project goals refer to the desired results of the project, and deliverables refer to specific tasks and tangible outcomes that enable the team to meet project goals. In general, project goals address the overall result that stakeholders are aiming to achieve.

For example, part of Sauce and Spoon's annual growth and expansion goals is launching the tablet roll out project, and one deliverable of the project is the successful installation of working tablets at two restaurant locations. 


Remember that scope refers to the boundaries of a project. Along with the scope, the charter contains information about work that's out-of-scope. Details that don't contribute to the project's goals are considered out of scope. 

A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach the project's goals. 

A charter can include other sections as well, such as budget and cost and success metrics.



## Project charters: Drafting SMART goals

Remember, project goals are the desired outcomes of the project.

## Project deliverables
Project deliverables are specific tasks or outcomes that contribute to the completion of a goal. 

## SMART GOAL
Remember, this means your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.

To make a goal more specific, make sure that it provides answers to questions like "What am I aiming to accomplish?" and "What are the requirements and constraints of this goal?" Here's a tip I like to use to add specificity to goals. Look for words in your goals that might be subjective or based on an opinion, such as bigger, better, or faster.

If you're having trouble making a goal measurable, research how others in your industry quantify success. This is called benchmarking, which refers to evaluating success against the standard. 


Some common metrics include 
1. table turnover rate, or the average length of time that a guest spends at their table;
2.  prime cost, which is the labor cost plus the total cost of goods like food and drink; 
3.  average check amount, which is the average amount of money guests spend on a given meal.


SMART goals are also attainable, which means that the goal is challenging but not impossible to reach. 

And all project goals should be relevant. Ask yourself, "Does it make sense for us as a company or as a project team to pursue this goal?" One best practice for determining the relevance of your project goals is to notice how closely your project goals align with the wider goals of your company or organization. 

For us, OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. For example, one of Sauce and Spoon's broader objectives is to make fresh, quick food for the working families in its community.

The last part of the SMART framework is to make your goal time-bound. You'll want to add a deadline to your goal so that you know when it's supposed to be completed. 

## Project charters: Defining scope, benefits, and costs

ext, you need to get aligned with your stakeholders on scope, benefits, and cost. We talked about scope earlier, but as a quick refresher, scope refers to the boundaries of the project; for example, the number of restaurants taking part in the pilot. 

To determine what's in- and out-of-scope, think about what's needed to achieve the project goal. 

Keep the following questions in mind: Which project details are your stakeholders aligned on that would be considered in-scope? Do your stakeholders disagree on any elements? Are there any details you should designate as out-of-scope for this particular project? As you think about these questions, take notes on what you find and refer to them as you complete the scope section of your project charter in the upcoming activity.

Benefits are the expected gains of a project. These can be direct, monetary gains, or indirect benefits, like an improvement in customer engagement or satisfaction. 

Costs refer to the money spent on project tasks and the prices of things like time, resources, and labor.

A budget is an estimate of the amount of money allocated to complete the project.

## Completing a stakeholder analysis

Let's get started. As we discussed earlier in the program, some common project aspects that are negotiated during the course of a project include 
1. scope
2. costs
3. benefits
4. timeline 
5. success criteria 
6. roles and responsibilities
7. resources

## stakeholder analysis
 A stakeholder analysis is a visual representation of all of the stakeholders. 
 
It helps you understand 
1. who your stakeholders are, 
2. what their priorities are, and 
3. how they prefer to communicate. 
4. It can help you determine how strongly you need to prioritize particular stakeholder's needs or goals on the project.

## stakeholder's influence
A stakeholder's influence is related to how much power they have and how much their actions affect the project outcome.

## stakeholder's interest
Interest refers to how much the stakeholder's needs will be affected by project operations and outcomes. 

## power-interest grid 
 Mapping these out on a power-interest grid will give you even more clarity about whom to prioritize and how best to approach negotiations with each stakeholder.
 
 
## Stakeholder management: Tips and takeaways
Stakeholder management is the process of maintaining good relationships with the people who have the most influence on your work. Efficiently managing stakeholders is an integral part of every project because it encourages good communication, teamwork, trust among members, and so much more. Without effective stakeholder management, a project is less likely to be successful. Read on for some tips and best practices for effective stakeholder management.

## Stakeholder management during project initiation
Identify all the stakeholders at the beginning of your project or initiative. Get everyone involved as early as possible to set clear expectations, responsibilities, and boundaries. Identifying your stakeholders early on gives them ample time to voice any concerns they may have about the project or their role within it. If they feel a sense of ownership from the beginning, your stakeholders may be more likely to embrace their roles, give appropriate input, and help remove barriers to allow the project to move forward.  

Keep the project vision clear. The project vision describes the need the project is fulfilling. It is important to have a clear, specific project vision because, as we have learned, stakeholders may apply pressure to increase the requirements, shorten the timeline, or cut resources. Ensuring that stakeholders have agreed upon the vision—and, more specifically, what "done" looks like—provides clarity for everyone involved with the project. Including highly-influential stakeholders in the strategic planning processes will make sure that all team members are aligned with project vision. 

Equip your stakeholders with user-friendly resources at all times. This could mean creating a one-pager (a one-page document that provides an overview of your project) or weekly status report with the latest information and links to the main project artifacts. It may also mean ensuring everyone has access to necessary documentation. 

## Stakeholder management throughout the project life cycle
As you work your way through the project life cycle, you will have to maintain good relationships with all of your stakeholders to ensure they are satisfied and contributing to the team. The following strategies can help you get to know your stakeholders’ interests, concerns, and communication preferences and enlist their help throughout your project’s life cycle:

Find out what stakeholders care about and why. Ask your stakeholders: What are your most important priorities and goals? What role would you like to play in this project? How will this project support you and your most important priorities?

Adjust your communication frequency and approach based on stakeholder roles and preferences. Tell your stakeholders: Here’s how I plan to keep you informed—does that work for you?

Enlist the help of senior stakeholders when necessary. Ask your stakeholders: Who else do you recommend I reach out to regarding this project? 

Once stakeholders have a vested interest, bring project problems to them. Ask your stakeholders: How would you handle this situation? What solutions come to mind?

## Key takeaway
Stakeholders can be your biggest allies as a project manager. Practicing your stakeholder management skills can help you enlist your stakeholders' support and keep them engaged throughout your project.
