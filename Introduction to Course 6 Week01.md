## Project charters: Purpose and components
You'll analyze project documents and supporting materials to identify project requirements, evaluate stakeholders, and problem solve. 

Strategic thinking involves analyzing documentation and talking with stakeholders to inform decisions based on the information available to you. 

A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach the project's goals. The project manager creates the charter during the initiation phase, which is the first phase of the project life cycle. 

The project charter helps you organize vital project information, create a framework for the work that needs to be done, and communicate those details to the necessary people. 

It's also useful as a reference throughout the project's life cycle, since it can help stakeholders realign on the project scope, goals, and costs.

The project charter contains key information about a project, like the summary, goals, and deliverables. The goal of the summary is to provide an overview of the project and to outline the goals you hope to accomplish.


Project goals refer to the desired results of the project, and deliverables refer to specific tasks and tangible outcomes that enable the team to meet project goals. In general, project goals address the overall result that stakeholders are aiming to achieve.

For example, part of Sauce and Spoon's annual growth and expansion goals is launching the tablet roll out project, and one deliverable of the project is the successful installation of working tablets at two restaurant locations. 


Remember that scope refers to the boundaries of a project. Along with the scope, the charter contains information about work that's out-of-scope. Details that don't contribute to the project's goals are considered out of scope. 

A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach the project's goals. 

A charter can include other sections as well, such as budget and cost and success metrics.



## Project charters: Drafting SMART goals

Remember, project goals are the desired outcomes of the project.

## Project deliverables
Project deliverables are specific tasks or outcomes that contribute to the completion of a goal. 

## SMART GOAL
Remember, this means your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.

To make a goal more specific, make sure that it provides answers to questions like "What am I aiming to accomplish?" and "What are the requirements and constraints of this goal?" Here's a tip I like to use to add specificity to goals. Look for words in your goals that might be subjective or based on an opinion, such as bigger, better, or faster.

If you're having trouble making a goal measurable, research how others in your industry quantify success. This is called benchmarking, which refers to evaluating success against the standard. 


Some common metrics include 
1. table turnover rate, or the average length of time that a guest spends at their table;
2.  prime cost, which is the labor cost plus the total cost of goods like food and drink; 
3.  average check amount, which is the average amount of money guests spend on a given meal.


SMART goals are also attainable, which means that the goal is challenging but not impossible to reach. 

And all project goals should be relevant. Ask yourself, "Does it make sense for us as a company or as a project team to pursue this goal?" One best practice for determining the relevance of your project goals is to notice how closely your project goals align with the wider goals of your company or organization. 

For us, OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. For example, one of Sauce and Spoon's broader objectives is to make fresh, quick food for the working families in its community.

The last part of the SMART framework is to make your goal time-bound. You'll want to add a deadline to your goal so that you know when it's supposed to be completed. 

## Project charters: Defining scope, benefits, and costs

ext, you need to get aligned with your stakeholders on scope, benefits, and cost. We talked about scope earlier, but as a quick refresher, scope refers to the boundaries of the project; for example, the number of restaurants taking part in the pilot. 

To determine what's in- and out-of-scope, think about what's needed to achieve the project goal. 

Keep the following questions in mind: Which project details are your stakeholders aligned on that would be considered in-scope? Do your stakeholders disagree on any elements? Are there any details you should designate as out-of-scope for this particular project? As you think about these questions, take notes on what you find and refer to them as you complete the scope section of your project charter in the upcoming activity.

Benefits are the expected gains of a project. These can be direct, monetary gains, or indirect benefits, like an improvement in customer engagement or satisfaction. 

Costs refer to the money spent on project tasks and the prices of things like time, resources, and labor.

A budget is an estimate of the amount of money allocated to complete the project.

## Completing a stakeholder analysis

Let's get started. As we discussed earlier in the program, some common project aspects that are negotiated during the course of a project include 
1. scope
2. costs
3. benefits
4. timeline 
5. success criteria 
6. roles and responsibilities
7. resources

## stakeholder analysis
 A stakeholder analysis is a visual representation of all of the stakeholders. 
 
It helps you understand 
1. who your stakeholders are, 
2. what their priorities are, and 
3. how they prefer to communicate. 
4. It can help you determine how strongly you need to prioritize particular stakeholder's needs or goals on the project.

## stakeholder's influence
A stakeholder's influence is related to how much power they have and how much their actions affect the project outcome.

## stakeholder's interest
Interest refers to how much the stakeholder's needs will be affected by project operations and outcomes. 

## power-interest grid 
 Mapping these out on a power-interest grid will give you even more clarity about whom to prioritize and how best to approach negotiations with each stakeholder.
 
 
## Stakeholder management: Tips and takeaways
Stakeholder management is the process of maintaining good relationships with the people who have the most influence on your work. Efficiently managing stakeholders is an integral part of every project because it encourages good communication, teamwork, trust among members, and so much more. Without effective stakeholder management, a project is less likely to be successful. Read on for some tips and best practices for effective stakeholder management.

## Stakeholder management during project initiation
Identify all the stakeholders at the beginning of your project or initiative. Get everyone involved as early as possible to set clear expectations, responsibilities, and boundaries. Identifying your stakeholders early on gives them ample time to voice any concerns they may have about the project or their role within it. If they feel a sense of ownership from the beginning, your stakeholders may be more likely to embrace their roles, give appropriate input, and help remove barriers to allow the project to move forward.  

Keep the project vision clear. The project vision describes the need the project is fulfilling. It is important to have a clear, specific project vision because, as we have learned, stakeholders may apply pressure to increase the requirements, shorten the timeline, or cut resources. Ensuring that stakeholders have agreed upon the vision—and, more specifically, what "done" looks like—provides clarity for everyone involved with the project. Including highly-influential stakeholders in the strategic planning processes will make sure that all team members are aligned with project vision. 

Equip your stakeholders with user-friendly resources at all times. This could mean creating a one-pager (a one-page document that provides an overview of your project) or weekly status report with the latest information and links to the main project artifacts. It may also mean ensuring everyone has access to necessary documentation. 

## Stakeholder management throughout the project life cycle
As you work your way through the project life cycle, you will have to maintain good relationships with all of your stakeholders to ensure they are satisfied and contributing to the team. The following strategies can help you get to know your stakeholders’ interests, concerns, and communication preferences and enlist their help throughout your project’s life cycle:

Find out what stakeholders care about and why. Ask your stakeholders: What are your most important priorities and goals? What role would you like to play in this project? How will this project support you and your most important priorities?

Adjust your communication frequency and approach based on stakeholder roles and preferences. Tell your stakeholders: Here’s how I plan to keep you informed—does that work for you?

Enlist the help of senior stakeholders when necessary. Ask your stakeholders: Who else do you recommend I reach out to regarding this project? 

Once stakeholders have a vested interest, bring project problems to them. Ask your stakeholders: How would you handle this situation? What solutions come to mind?

## Key takeaway
Stakeholders can be your biggest allies as a project manager. Practicing your stakeholder management skills can help you enlist your stakeholders' support and keep them engaged throughout your project.

## Finding mutually beneficial solutions
As a project manager, you've got a lot of helpful tools at your disposal, but even the most skilled negotiators have to put their skills to the test in order to meet project goals and gain stakeholder satisfaction. 

 You'll need to use negotiating techniques to move a disagreement from stalemate to solution. After this video, you'll identify shared benefits for your stakeholders that you'll eventually use to write a negotiation email.
 
 When it comes to project management, persuasion and negotiation are constructive tools you can use to 
 1. enhance communication, 
 2. clarify wants and needs, and 
 3. achieve workable solutions for everyone involved. 

 It's important that you view the people you're negotiating with as your colleagues and peers, not as opponents. 
 
When you experience conflict or disagreement among your stakeholders, it's in your best interest to address those challenges, build consensus among the stakeholder groups, and deescalate conflict.

## Mutual benefit
Mutual benefit is when all parties involved gain some kind of benefit or advantage.

The goal here is to reach a solution that maximizes benefits, minimizes losses, and is fair for all.


Now, as much as you want to satisfy your stakeholders, it's just as important to think about what tradeoffs you're willing to make. To do this successfully, you need a clear understanding of project priorities. You have to know what's most important when it comes to scope, timeline, and budget. 

## triple constraint model
A common tool used for determining priorities is the triple constraint model, or the iron triangle, which we covered in an earlier course. The triple constraint will help you decide if a project request is acceptable and what impact it'll have. 

### Negotiating scope with stakeholders
Even after you’ve established the project’s scope, some stakeholders may want to discuss adjusting it. They may feel that the project’s current scope will require too much work with too few resources, that the timeline isn’t realistic given the scope, or that the project requires additional tasks and objectives. When your stakeholders ask to revisit a project’s scope, you should meet with them so they can raise their concerns. Knowing how to effectively facilitate scope negotiations will allow you to reach solutions that are suitable for everyone. 

Tips for navigating scope with stakeholders
Understand motivations. Before your discussion, consider each stakeholder's motivations for wanting to adjust the project’s scope. Some of those motivations are budgetary (such as wanting to reduce the project’s costs), some are interpersonal (such as wanting more time to complete tasks), and some are related to personal career goals (such as maintaining their current position or striving for a promotion). Understanding your stakeholders’ motivations can help you work together to find a compromise. 

Set the scene. Start the discussion with a reflection on why you are meeting. Remind your stakeholders why you are engaged in this project, and assure them that you all share a common goal.

Listen first. Hear what your stakeholders have to say before you present your views. This will demonstrate your desire to understand the other party’s perspective. Acknowledging their point of view may make it easier for them to accept your suggestions or solutions when their ideas or opinions differ from yours.

Ask questions to define goals. Be thorough and ask as many questions as you feel necessary to understand what the stakeholder wants. This might include getting them to define their customer or business goals. Strive for getting specific, measurable details from your stakeholders, so that later, you’ll be able to determine whether you’ve successfully met their goals. Eliciting language that is measurable (rather than subjective or unclear) will help you define goals. An example of a specific, measurable goal could be: “We want to cut the amount of time it takes customers to sign up for our newsletter by at least 30 percent.”

Explain the “why” before the “what.” When attempting to persuade stakeholders—or anyone, for that matter—to see things your way, explain the reasons for your request before describing what you want. For instance, start by explaining the value that could be added to your company or project by defining scope in a certain way. If stakeholders understand where you’re coming from first, they’re more likely to grant your request when you ask for it.

Do not oversell. Sometimes it’s best to state your case and give others some time to respond. After you have presented your reasons, position, and request, withdraw slightly to give your audience time to process what you have said. Think of your silence, in this situation, as a sign of respect for your stakeholders; it shows them you want to hear from them. And, if they are quiet for a while, it means that you have stimulated thought.  

Be creative. Working to find alternative solutions can quickly turn a heavy negotiation into an inspiring team effort. To find real solutions to negotiation stalemates, think creatively about all the aspects of the project. You may find that there is more than one solution to differing opinions. 

Do not make it personal. Always focus on what is good for the project. If personal considerations enter into the discussion, reframe the conversation by bringing up objective facts.

Seek a win-win outcome. Finally, consider what it will take for the other side to be satisfied. Then, try to identify a way to ensure you are satisfied as well. There will be times when one party may have to compromise more than the other,  but a mutually beneficial agreement (an agreement that benefits all parties involved) should always be the goal. The next reading will cover strategies for achieving mutually beneficial agreements with stakeholders. 


### Achieving a win-win outcome
In the last reading, you learned about effective ways to negotiate a project’s scope with stakeholders. The goal when negotiating with stakeholders should always be achieving a win-win outcome, or a mutually beneficial agreement. This is an agreement that benefits all parties involved. Mutually beneficial agreements aren’t only for internal stakeholders, though. They are an important part of the process for negotiating with vendors, contractors, suppliers, and more. 

Best practices for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement
Share information. Sometimes in negotiations, one or both parties might think they need to withhold information in order to not give too much away. This isn’t very effective, though. It is best to strive for open lines of communication, where each party shares their worries and preferences. For instance, if your team’s last supplier provided you with low quality products, you might voice this as a concern so your expectations around quality are clear. 

Ask questions and listen actively to responses. Just like you shared your concerns and expectations, you can ask the other party questions to clarify what their concerns and expectations are. That way, both parties will have shared all the necessary information to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Propose multiple options whenever possible. In negotiations, presenting only one option or solution can set you up for failure because the other person might think your first offer is the only one. If the other party rejects all of your proposals, ask them to communicate which one they like best, as that may point you in the direction of finding a solution that works for everyone.


## Expert 
Managing stakeholders is really important as a program manager because the stakeholders might not always know what's going on. 

## Applying influence in negotiations

Dr. Jay Conger lists these four steps to effectively influence: 
1. establish credibility, 
2. frame for common ground, 
3. provide evidence and 
4. connect emotionally.
