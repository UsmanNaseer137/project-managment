## Project charters: Purpose and components
You'll analyze project documents and supporting materials to identify project requirements, evaluate stakeholders, and problem solve. 

Strategic thinking involves analyzing documentation and talking with stakeholders to inform decisions based on the information available to you. 

A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach the project's goals. The project manager creates the charter during the initiation phase, which is the first phase of the project life cycle. 

The project charter helps you organize vital project information, create a framework for the work that needs to be done, and communicate those details to the necessary people. 

It's also useful as a reference throughout the project's life cycle, since it can help stakeholders realign on the project scope, goals, and costs.

The project charter contains key information about a project, like the summary, goals, and deliverables. The goal of the summary is to provide an overview of the project and to outline the goals you hope to accomplish.


Project goals refer to the desired results of the project, and deliverables refer to specific tasks and tangible outcomes that enable the team to meet project goals. In general, project goals address the overall result that stakeholders are aiming to achieve.

For example, part of Sauce and Spoon's annual growth and expansion goals is launching the tablet roll out project, and one deliverable of the project is the successful installation of working tablets at two restaurant locations. 


Remember that scope refers to the boundaries of a project. Along with the scope, the charter contains information about work that's out-of-scope. Details that don't contribute to the project's goals are considered out of scope. 

A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach the project's goals. 

A charter can include other sections as well, such as budget and cost and success metrics.



## Project charters: Drafting SMART goals

Remember, project goals are the desired outcomes of the project.

## Project deliverables
Project deliverables are specific tasks or outcomes that contribute to the completion of a goal. 

## SMART GOAL
Remember, this means your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.

To make a goal more specific, make sure that it provides answers to questions like "What am I aiming to accomplish?" and "What are the requirements and constraints of this goal?" Here's a tip I like to use to add specificity to goals. Look for words in your goals that might be subjective or based on an opinion, such as bigger, better, or faster.

If you're having trouble making a goal measurable, research how others in your industry quantify success. This is called benchmarking, which refers to evaluating success against the standard. 


Some common metrics include 
1. table turnover rate, or the average length of time that a guest spends at their table;
2.  prime cost, which is the labor cost plus the total cost of goods like food and drink; 
3.  average check amount, which is the average amount of money guests spend on a given meal.


SMART goals are also attainable, which means that the goal is challenging but not impossible to reach. 

And all project goals should be relevant. Ask yourself, "Does it make sense for us as a company or as a project team to pursue this goal?" One best practice for determining the relevance of your project goals is to notice how closely your project goals align with the wider goals of your company or organization. 

For us, OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. For example, one of Sauce and Spoon's broader objectives is to make fresh, quick food for the working families in its community.

The last part of the SMART framework is to make your goal time-bound. You'll want to add a deadline to your goal so that you know when it's supposed to be completed. 

## Project charters: Defining scope, benefits, and costs

ext, you need to get aligned with your stakeholders on scope, benefits, and cost. We talked about scope earlier, but as a quick refresher, scope refers to the boundaries of the project; for example, the number of restaurants taking part in the pilot. 

To determine what's in- and out-of-scope, think about what's needed to achieve the project goal. 

Keep the following questions in mind: Which project details are your stakeholders aligned on that would be considered in-scope? Do your stakeholders disagree on any elements? Are there any details you should designate as out-of-scope for this particular project? As you think about these questions, take notes on what you find and refer to them as you complete the scope section of your project charter in the upcoming activity.

Benefits are the expected gains of a project. These can be direct, monetary gains, or indirect benefits, like an improvement in customer engagement or satisfaction. 

Costs refer to the money spent on project tasks and the prices of things like time, resources, and labor.

A budget is an estimate of the amount of money allocated to complete the project.
