## Project charters: Drafting SMART goals

Remember, project goals are the desired outcomes of the project.

## Project deliverables
Project deliverables are specific tasks or outcomes that contribute to the completion of a goal. 

## SMART GOAL
Remember, this means your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.

To make a goal more specific, make sure that it provides answers to questions like "What am I aiming to accomplish?" and "What are the requirements and constraints of this goal?" Here's a tip I like to use to add specificity to goals. Look for words in your goals that might be subjective or based on an opinion, such as bigger, better, or faster.

If you're having trouble making a goal measurable, research how others in your industry quantify success. This is called benchmarking, which refers to evaluating success against the standard. 


Some common metrics include 
1. table turnover rate, or the average length of time that a guest spends at their table;
2.  prime cost, which is the labor cost plus the total cost of goods like food and drink; 
3.  average check amount, which is the average amount of money guests spend on a given meal.


SMART goals are also attainable, which means that the goal is challenging but not impossible to reach.
