## Introduction: Implementing Scrum

## Building a Product Backlog

## Product Backlog
Single authoritative source for things that a team works on. It contains all of the features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project. 

## Product Backlog Features
1. Living Artifact : meaning that items are added to the Backlog at any time.
2. The Product Backlog is owned and adjusted by the product owner.
3. Product Backlog is always a prioritized list of features.

Remember, the Product Backlog is the guide and roadmap of your product. 

## Best Practices
1. Description  : Item description
2. The Value :  How much business value the item delivers to the customers, to the team, or to the users.  $ to $$$$
3. The order : 
4. The Estimate : Time


## Writing user stories

## User Story
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. 

## Parts of User Story
1. User
2. Action
3. Benefit

As a user role, I want this action so that I can get this value.

## INVEST
Independent: The story should be able to be started and finished by itself. It's not dependent on another story to finish it. 
Negotiable : There's room for negotiation and discussion about this item. 
Valuable: This means that completing the user story has to deliver value.
Estimatable : Our Definition of Done must be clear so that the team can give each user story an estimate. 
Small :  Each user story needs to be able to fit within a planned Sprint.
Testable :  A test can be written to check and make sure that it meets the acceptance criteria.

## Epic 
A  group or collection of user stories.

Example:
As a Virtual Verde client, I would like to acquire a bonsai tree so that I can have a beautiful plant and I can meditate as I trim the branches.

## Acceptance Criteria
Owner creates something called the acceptance criteria, which is essentially the checklist you will use to decide whether the user story is done. 

## The components of user stories and epics
In the previous video, we introduced user stories and epics. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a deliverable told from the perspective of the user. Creating user stories helps the team develop a solution that is always centered around the user’s needs and overall experience. 

You also learned that epics are a collection of user stories. Think of the concept of user stories in terms of books or films. A story is one single narrative, while an epic is a set of several related, independent stories. Each story tells a specific chronicle, while an epic gives a high-level view of the overall arc. 

## User stories
The driving factor behind every Scrum project is putting the customer first. User stories are a key component of ensuring that customers are satisfied with the product. A team writes a user story from the perspective of the user. Not only do user stories provide insight into what goals the user wants to achieve, but they enable collaboration, inspire creative solutions, and create momentum by giving the team a small win when the stories are developed. 

When writing user stories, you will need to include the following components: 
1. User persona. What is your user like? What is their relation to the project? What goals do they have? 
2. Definition of Done. This refers to an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a user story can be considered complete. 
3. Tasks. What are the key activities needed to complete the user story?
4. Any feedback already provided. If you are adding features to an existing product and you have already received feedback from customers on a past iteration, make sure to consider this feedback.  

## Epics
An epic’s purpose is to help manage related user stories. In this post, Mike Cohn, the inventor of the term “epic” as it relates to Scrum, describes epic as a “very large user story”—one that could not be delivered within a single iteration and may need to be split into smaller stories. The team should discuss together and reach a shared view of how to write and capture their user stories and epics. Keep in mind, epics are just larger user stories that are there to help organize the project. 

Let’s imagine you are creating user stories and epics based on the previous example. User stories may include customers wanting to read reviews of books on the website or wanting to add books to their cart. These user stories could fall into the “website creation” epic. 

Another user story could be that customers want to walk into the library and easily find the non-fiction section. This would fall under the “organization of the physical space” epic.

So rather than those various user stories appearing in a list together, they are organized into sections, or epics.

## Key takeaway
Epics allow you to keep track of large, loosely-defined ideas, while user stories are a much smaller unit of work, inspired directly from the end user or customer. Both user stories and epics help teams ensure they are delivering value to the customer.

## Agile effort estimation techniques
There are all kinds of techniques to use when estimating effort in an Agile way. Effective relative effort estimation leads to successful and predictable sprint outcomes, which leads to a successful project overall. Generally speaking, the main steps to Agile estimation are the same, even if the specific approach varies. Some examples of Agile estimation techniques are: 

1. Planning Poker™
2. Dot Voting
3. The Bucket System
4. Large/Uncertain/Small
5. Ordering Method
6. Affinity Mapping

## Planning Poker™
This particular method is well-known and commonly used when Scrum teams have to make effort estimates for a small number of items (under 10). Planning Poker is consensus-based, meaning that everyone has to agree on the number chosen. In this technique, each individual has a deck of cards with numbers from the Fibonacci sequence on them. The Fibonacci sequence is where a number is the sum of the last two numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). 

Sometimes, Planning Poker decks also include cards with coffee cups and question marks on them. The question mark card means that the person doesn’t understand what is being discussed or doesn’t have enough information to draw a conclusion. The coffee cup card means that the person needs a break.

The Planning Poker strategy is used in Sprint Planning meetings. As each Product Backlog item/user story is discussed, each team member lays a card face down on the table. Then, everyone turns their card over at the same time and the team discusses the estimates, particularly when they are far apart from one another. By first hiding the estimates, the group avoids any bias that is presented when numbers are said aloud. Sometimes, when hearing numbers aloud, people react to that estimate or the estimator themselves, and it changes what their initial thought may have been. In Planning Poker, teams can easily avoid that bias.

## Dot Voting 
Dot Voting, like Planning Poker, is also good for sprints with a low number of Sprint Backlog items. In Dot Voting, each team member starts with small dot stickers, color-coded by the estimated effort required (e.g., S=green, M=blue, L=orange, XL=red). The items or user stories are written out on pieces of paper placed around a table or put up on the wall. Then, team members walk around the table and add their colored stickers to the items. 

## The Bucket System
The Bucket System is helpful for backlogs with many items since it can be done very quickly. In fact, a couple hundred items can be estimated in just one hour with the Bucket System. The Bucket System is an effective strategy for sizing items because it explores each item in terms of pre-determined "buckets" of complexity. Keep in mind that these buckets are metaphorical; this strategy doesn't require the use of actual buckets, and instead uses sticky notes or note cards as buckets.

In this technique, the team starts by setting up a line of note cards down the center of the table, each marked with a number representing a level of effort. Then, the team writes each item or user story on a card. Each person draws and reads a random item,  then places it somewhere along the line of numbered note cards. There is no need to discuss further with the team. If a person draws an item that they do not understand, then they can offer it to someone else to place. Additionally, if a person finds an item that they think does not fit where it was placed, they can discuss it with the team until a consensus about a more accurate placement is reached. Team members should spend no more than 120 seconds on each item.  

## Large/Uncertain/Small 
Large/Uncertain/Small is another quick method of rough estimation. It is great for product backlogs that have several similar or comparable items. 

This is the same general idea as the Bucket System, but instead of several buckets, you only use three categories: large, uncertain, and small. Starting with the simpler, more obvious user stories, the team places the items in one of the categories. Then, the team discusses and places more complex items until each is assigned to a category.

## Ordering Method
The Ordering Method is ideal for projects with a smaller team and a large number of Product Backlog items. First, a scale is prepared and items are randomly placed ranging from low to high. Then, one at a time, each team member either moves any item one spot lower or higher on the scale or passes their turn. This continues until team members no longer want to move any items. 

## Affinity Mapping
Affinity Mapping is useful for teams that have more than 20 items in their Product Backlog. 

A best practice is to conduct this technique using sticky notes placed onto a wall, whiteboard, or table. Each sticky note features a different user story or item. Using sticky notes allows the team to move user stories around in order to group them by similar theme, group, and pattern. The team begins by placing one sticky note on the board. Then, the team takes the next sticky note and discusses whether it is similar to the first item. Based on the team’s assessment, the second sticky note is placed in the first group or into its own group. 

After all of the items are grouped (there should be anywhere from 3–10 groups total), the team gives a name to each group that represents the general theme of the items. Then, the groups are prioritized by importance so that the team knows which items to tackle first. 

## Characteristics of effective estimation
Regardless of which technique your team chooses, there are several important characteristics the techniques share that lead to effective estimation:
1. Avoids gathering false precision of estimates. In Scrum, assigning rough estimates results in more accuracy across the project. Therefore, if the team focuses on identifying relative estimates—rather than a team having a lengthy debate about whether a task will take seven or 10 days of work—the team saves time and avoids potentially missing deadlines.
2. Avoids anchoring bias. Many of these techniques (e.g., Planning Poker) keep the initial estimate private, which allows team members to form an independent opinion on the estimate before sharing their thoughts with the team. This prevents a known phenomenon called anchoring bias, where individuals find themselves compelled to put forth estimates similar to others in the room to avoid 
3. Promotes inclusivity. These group estimation techniques not only lead to better estimates but also help the team develop trust and cohesiveness.
4. Leads to effort discovery. Estimating in these dynamic ways can help the team uncover strategies to get items completed which might otherwise not have been revealed.

## Key takeaway
There are several strategies to enlist when it comes to estimating effort and ordering your Product Backlog. Any one of these techniques are useful. Choosing a particular strategy is just a matter of what your team prefers. 

## T-shirt sizes and story points
In the previous videos, you learned about T-shirt sizes and story points—the two most common units used to help teams estimate user stories in Agile projects. In this reading, we will explore the processes of estimating user stories in these units. 

As a recap, relative estimation means to compare the effort estimated for completing a backlog item to the effort estimated for another backlog item. Doing this instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take allows your comparisons and estimates to be more accurate relative to one another.

## T-shirt sizes
At first, T-shirt sizes may seem like a somewhat unusual way to measure an item or user story. But when you think about assigning estimations to items based on sizes (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL), it is actually very helpful and easy. Some of the benefits to using this technique are that it is quick, well understood by Agile experts, and a good introduction for teams who are just learning relative estimation. 

So what does the process of assigning T-shirt sizes entail? There are several specific techniques a team can try, but each generally follows these steps. The team: 

1. Agrees on the chosen scale and metrics to be used.
2. Identifies at least one anchor backlog item. That item will be assigned a T-shirt size. Some teams will choose two anchor items—one at the top of the range and one at the bottom of the range.
3. Sorts through the remaining backlog items and agrees on T-shirt sizes for each of them. 

## Story points
Using story points as the estimate unit is a little more advanced than T-shirt sizes, but it is essentially the same concept. This method is good for experienced teams. When using story points, teams usually use the Fibonacci sequence. As a reminder, this sequence comes from adding the two previous numbers in the sequence together. For example, 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5. The important thing to notice about this sequence is that, as the list continues on, the numbers spread further apart from each other. Because of this, story points provide more accuracy and specificity than T-shirt sizes. 

So what does the process of assigning story points entail? There are several specific techniques a team can try, but the basic steps are the same as with T-shirt sizes. The team: 

1. Agrees on the permitted points values. Some teams cap the size at a certain number, like 21. Some teams decide to jump from 21 to 100 as the next larger value. This is a team decision.

2. Identifies at least one anchor backlog item and agrees to assign it a points value. Some teams will choose two anchor items, one at the top of the range and one at the bottom of the range.

3. Sorts through the remaining backlog items as a team, agrees on an estimate for each item, and captures it in the backlog management system. 

Best practices
1. Some best practices, regardless of the technique you use, include:
2. Asking the Product Owner questions about the user story or item to ensure that there is enough information to estimate it.
3. Discussing divergent estimates from various team members so that everyone has a chance to understand how to implement the item.
4. Agreeing on the final T-shirt sizes or points value and capturing it in the system.
5. If certain items fall into the larger T-shirt size or story points value range, discussing whether it makes sense to break them down into smaller pieces before moving on.

## Key takeaway
Either of these effort estimation units are effective at estimating your items and user stories. As a team, it is important to spend the appropriate amount of time deciding which is best for you. If you are a less experienced team, try starting out with T-shirt sizes, but more advanced teams should feel free to use either method.

## Introduction to the Sprint

## Sprint
1. Sprints, which we also called iterations, provide the whole rhythm for the team and is one of the five Scrum events. 
2. Within a Sprint, the amount of work is planned based on the historical capacity of the team and is made ready for the Sprint Planning event. 
3. It might help to think of each Sprint as a mini-project with planning, execution, delivery, closing, and a retrospective all wrapped into this bite-sized package. 

## The Scrum Guide
The Scrum Guide technically defines five events: 
1. Sprint
2. Sprint Planning
3. Daily Scrum
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective.

## Timeboxes
1. create a sense of urgency which will drive prioritization
2. provide a window of focus which improves productivity
3. help the team develop a predictable rhythm to their work
4. 1 to 4 weeks

## Consideration
1. First, think about what you expect the frequency of changes to be. if requriment change every week then weely sprint.
2. Second, think about how much focus time your solution developers might need to build a Backlog item.
3. Third, think about how much overhead goes into a delivery of your product.

## The Sprint: The Scrum Guide overview
## The Sprint
Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.

They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

## During the Sprint:
1. No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
2. Quality does not decrease;
3. The Product Backlog is refined as needed; 
4. Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

## Sprint planning
1. For Sprint Planning, the entire Scrum team comes together and meets to confirm how much capacity, meaning time and people, are available during this Sprint, and then they identify what items from the Backlog will be done during the Sprint.
2. This becomes the Sprint Backlog, and ultimately, the Sprint goal. 

## Questions
1. Who is available during this Sprint?
2. Are there any vacations or conflicts that we should know about?
3. What has been our average velocity, meaning how many points or Backlog items have we been able to complete in a single Sprint in the past?
4. What can and should be accomplished by the team in this upcoming Sprint?
5. What is the ultimate Sprint goal? How will the work get done?
6. who is responsible for what tasks? 

## Definition of Done
 Definition of Done refers to an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before our user story or Backlog item can be considered complete.
 
 1. the code or solution itself is reviewed by an independent peer group.
 2. The product or unit passes all testing requirements, which could include security or performance testing.
 3. Documentation is completed. 
 4. All user story acceptance criteria specified by the product owner is met. 
 5. And finally, the product owner accepts the user story.

## The Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is the set of product Backlog items that are identified for completion during the upcoming Sprint. 
In other words, the Sprint Backlog is a subset of items from the Product Backlog that you'll aim to finish during that particular Sprint.

## The Daily Scrum and Sprint Review

## Daily Scrum or Standup 
1. Daily Scrum, which is sometimes referred to as stand up, is a time for the Scrum Team to synchronize and prioritize activities for the day. 
2. In 15 minutes, and at the same time and place every day, each team member answers the following questions:
   1.  What did I do yesterday?
   2.  What will I do today ?
   3.  Do I notice any impediment (obstacle)?
3. Daily stand ups should provide the Scrum Master with the opportunity to quickly unblock the team with little delay.
4.  Daily Stand-ups are an opportunity to reinforce focus on the Sprint Backlog and Sprint Goal. 

## Sprint Review
1. The Sprint Review is a meeting with the entire Scrum Team where the product is demonstrated in order to determine which aspects are finished and which aren't. 
2. During a Sprint Review, the Development Team and Product Owner will play a heavy role in this inspection and discussion.
## Cover
1. exploration of which items should be considered done in the Product Backlog
2. they'll demonstrate and inspect the product. 

## The Product Increment
1. The Product Increment is what's produced after a given Sprint and is considered releasable. 

## Releasable 
A product is releasable when the team has developed a Minimum Viable Product, which has a set of implemented features or requirements.

## MVP
 A Minimum Viable Product is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers.
 
 ## The Sprint Retrospective
1. The Sprint Retrospective is an essential meeting of up to three hours for the Scrum Team to take a step back, reflect, and identify improvements about how to work together as a team. 
2. In a Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team will reflect on what's working or not working for the team regarding the people, the processes, and the tools.
3. What improvements are worth exploring in the next Sprint? 
4. What improvements were put in place for the last Sprint?Were they helpful or not, and why? 

## blameless
6. First, it's important to demonstrate the Scrum value of respect and always allow the team to remain blameless. 
7. If any team member is worried there may be negative consequences for providing feedback, your outcome won't be as beneficial.
8. Create a safe space for candor by acknowledging potential awkwardness and, if needed, create a space for anonymous or private feedback.

## Participation
 Participation is key because retrospectives only work if participants feel like their input matters.
 
## balance the negative with the positive.
Next, balance the negative with the positive. Don't just ask where you can improve, but also ask things like, where did we notice success? You want your team to feel like they were successful, and you also want to recreate these successful outcomes.

## act on it.
Finally, make sure to act on it. Teams can get discouraged from participating in future retrospectives if it feels like their feedback won't inspire change.

## Readings

## Sprint Retrospectives: Pitfalls and best practices
Throughout this program, we have discussed retrospectives. Retrospectives are an integral aspect of project management, especially true when it comes to working in Scrum. As we mentioned in the previous video, retrospectives are one of the five Sprint events in Scrum. In this reading, you will learn some best practices to implement and pitfalls to avoid when conducting Sprint Retrospectives. 

##  Sprint Retrospectives
As a refresher, retrospectives are workshops or meetings that give project teams time to reflect on a project and brainstorm potential future improvements. In the Scrum framework, Sprint Retrospectives occur at the end of each Sprint, which is usually every one-to-four weeks. 

Sprint Retrospectives are a key practice that supports the Scrum theory and values. They are a critical moment to inspect and adapt to the outcomes produced within the Sprint timebox. Retrospectives occur much more often in Scrum than in traditional project management,  so it is important to consider some best practices and pitfalls to avoid to help make them engaging and productive for the entire team.


## Pitfalls
Avoid too many gimmicks. 
There are many fun games and exercises that can be used by a Scrum Master when facilitating a Sprint Retrospective. However, not all teams enjoy this style. Consider using these exercises only occasionally or when the team asks for new ways of doing retrospectives.

## Try not to only focus on the negative. 
Not only is it necessary for the team to recognize what’s not working well, it is also important to highlight where they exceeded expectations. This ensures that the team both avoids failures and repeats successes as well.

## Avoid changing processes after each retrospective. 
It is okay to keep a new process in place for a few Sprints before deciding whether it was useful or not. You can always make note of opportunities for change, but try to wait a few Sprints before implementing new changes.

## Best practices
Ask open-ended, probing questions. 
Ask questions that require thoughtful discussion rather than a yes-or-no answer. For example, ask, “How could we have better achieved our Sprint Goal?” rather than “Did we achieve the Sprint Goal?””

## Consider diverse styles of communication and participation. 
Make it easy for all team members to contribute their ideas and feedback. For example, not everyone feels comfortable speaking up in a large group. Try things like starting the retrospective with silent reflection by journaling or putting the team into pairs before starting a larger group conversation.

Cover the many aspects of the Sprint when conducting a retrospective.

The productivity and efficiency of the team

The scope and understanding of the definition of done

Communication and interactions within the team

Stakeholder communication

Progress towards more long-range release plans

Consider reflecting periodically on Scrum theory and values by asking specific questions. 
For example, ask, “How could the team become more transparent?” or “How did we abide by our Scrum values in this Sprint?”


## Velocity and burndown charts
## burndown charts
1. A burndown chart measures time against the amount of work done and the amount of work remaining.
2. The goal of using a burndown chart is to keep the team aware of how they're doing against their overall goals.
3. In a Scrum Team, burndown charts reflect how the team is doing with completing user stories during the Sprint.
4. The Scrum Master will review the burndown chart, sometimes daily, to examine if the team will hit their goals or not.

## Velocity
velocity is a measure of how many points a team burns down during a single Sprint on average. 

1. First, there's no such thing as a good velocity or bad velocity.
2. The next thing is that each team will have a different velocity, especially since each team decides their own point system calibration. 

1. You can tell them approximately how long it will take to complete the entire Product Backlog
2. how much of your Backlog will be completed by a particular time.


## Interpreting velocity: Dos and Don'ts
In the previous video, we defined velocity as “The measure of how many points the team burns down in a given Sprint on average.” Velocity measures the amount of work a single team can be expected to complete during an iteration. When we refer to story points, we are referring to a unit of measurement that expresses the estimated effort required to implement that Product Backlog item. These story points are calibrated and decided on by the team.

##  Calculating velocity
As described in the video and readings, estimating effort can be done in a variety of units. Most often in Agile teams, story points or T-shirt sizes are used to estimate effort. If you use T-shirt sizes, your team will map those sizes to a numeric value for the purpose of calculating a team velocity. 

When your team begins running Sprints or iterations, they won’t be able to accurately determine velocity because they will have no historical basis on which to calculate an average number of points completed in a Sprint. In their very first Sprint, your team will make a rough guess as to how many items they can complete just to get started. Once a few Sprints have been completed, your team will have a good measure of their velocity, and they will use that number to determine which items to include in their Sprint Backlog. This should be easy to do if your team has a properly prioritized and estimated backlog to work from. As you will recall from the videos, this process is called backlog refinement.

##  Using velocity for good 
When interpreting velocity, it is important to keep a few things in mind. You may feel inclined to share velocity with members outside of your team or to use velocity as a performance or comparison metric. You may also feel inclined to use it to determine a projected delivery date. However, some Agile experts warn against these practices. Let’s discuss why. 

Velocity can be helpful for individuals outside of the Scrum team, but when sharing it with non-team members, be very careful. Since velocity is different for every team, a stakeholder may not have enough context to interpret it. Be sure to share relevant supporting materials to help add context. A good example of this is sharing the velocity with a corresponding date range and visualization that indicates trends over time. There may be dips and spikes in velocity that draw insights and encourage improvements in future projects. 

It is natural for individuals to want to quantify performance through data, but it can be detrimental for a team to feel that kind of pressure within their Sprints. There may be executives, sponsors, or stakeholders that want to use velocity as a performance metric, but this will only hurt the team by encouraging tactics like intimidation. If the team is worried about their velocity making it seem like they are underperforming, the team’s culture can become harmed as a result. 

If you are leading a few different Scrum teams, you may be tempted to compare the two teams’ productivity based on their velocity. You may have the impulse to check which teams are completing the most story points per iteration. However, the weight of different story points is subjective because they are created by the team. One team may consider a story to be five points, but another team might consider it to be closer to three points. Therefore, judging productivity solely on velocity isn’t accurate or fair. Additionally, velocity is not a measure of value. One team’s velocity might differ from another team’s, but this variability is fine as long as both teams are delivering value to your stakeholders.

Using velocity to estimate the delivery date of a project spanning numerous Sprints can be tricky. Velocity can be used as a pressure point by external stakeholders who want to set a date for their product launch. Velocity can also create false expectations and a harshly competitive culture when the team doesn’t hit the estimated dates. Projecting deliverable dates is harmful because it can take a team several Sprints to really understand what they are capable of delivering in each iteration. Also, if you map out too many dates in advance, you aren’t able to account for the changes and issues that will arise. Therefore, make sure you are being careful not to use the estimated delivery dates as commitments. 

## Utilizing Kanban boards
Scrum and kanban boards have three main features that make it a great Sprint tracking tool for Scrum Teams. 
1. There's visualization
2. work-in-progress limits (also known as WIP limits) : We learned earlier in this course that common WIP limits are constraints on how many work items the team actively works on at any given time.

## Tools for transparency and collaboration
Asana, Jira, Trello
4. flow of work.
