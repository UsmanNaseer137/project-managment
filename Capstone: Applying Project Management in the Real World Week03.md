## Introduction: Maintaining quality
1. Practice defining quality standards for your project. 
2. Evaluate how successfully the project's standards are being met
3. Present your findings to stakeholders.
4. You'll also create a retrospective document, which project managers use during discussions about project progress, and any process improvements that need to be made. 


## Quality Planning
Quality planning refers to the process that the project manager or the team establishes and follows for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole and how to satisfy them. We can't just launch a project and assume everything will be okay.

Remember, as a project manager, you're responsible for the planning and execution of the project, as well as for the successful completion of the project.

## Quality management

## Quality Managment Concepts
1. Quality Planning
2. Quality Standard : which are the requirements, specifications, or guidelines that could be used to ensure the materials, products, processes, and services are fit for achieving a desired outcome
3. Quality Assurance : which is a review process that evaluates whether your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product
4. Quality Control : Quality control refers to the techniques that are used to ensure quality standards are maintained when a problem is identified

## Quality Managment Plan
1. Documents all the information needed to effectively manage quality throughout the project life cycle.

## Defining quality standards

## Quality
Quality means making sure that you deliver what you say you will and that you do so as efficiently as you can.

## Quality standards
Quality standards are the requirements and specifications that your product or service must meet in order to be considered successful by your organization and the customer.

## Resources to Consult
1. Project Document : Business Case + Project Charter
2. Conversations with experts and stakeholders
3. You can do some industry research.

For example, software and construction industries have established quality standards related to 
1. Functionality
2. Design
3. Safety
4. Productivity
5. Effectiveness
6. Customer satisfaction

It's important that your standards are objective and measurable so you can clearly identify that the standard has been met. 

## Creating evaluation questions

## Quality Assurance
Remember, quality assurance consists of reviewing processes to evaluate whether or not your project is delivering an acceptable level of quality. 

## Evaluation
Evaluation involves observing, measuring, and then comparing your findings to a set of agreed upon criteria.

## Examples of quality assurance are 
1. Beta testing
2. Internal checklists
3. Feedback surveys

Evaluation is a form of research designed to promote learning and inform decisions. 

## Reason to use Evaluation 
1. To Improve
2. To Judge
3. To Learn

## Evaluation Process
1. Determin the reason of evaluating
2. Write out your evaluation questions. 

## Evaluation Question 
An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness of your project or program. 

There are two main categories of evaluation questions: 
1. Questions that ask how you can make improvements
2. Questions that help you measure and compare. 

## Questions that ask how you can make improvements
1. How can we improve? 
2. What is working?
3. what's not working? 
4. Which goals are being met? 
5. Who is benefiting? 
6. What are the most common participant reactions? 


## Write out your evaluation questions. 
1. What were the results?
2. Were there unintended outcomes? 
3. What were the costs and benefits? 
4. Are there any lessons to be learned?
5. Should we continue?

## Effective Evaluation Question
1. They address stakeholder or user values, interests, and concerns; 
2. They relate to the purpose of the project and of evaluation, they're worth answering and are important for the project and beyond;
3. They're practical and feasible to answer with available resources. 

## Determining evaluation indicators
1. Evaluation indicators reveal the specific type of data that needs to be collected to help you answer your evaluation questions.
 
2. Similar to the way quality standards add specificity to your deliverables and goals, evaluation indicators take your evaluation question and determine the specific type of response you're aiming for.
3.  Another way to think of indicators is that they provide pathways for answering your evaluation questions.
4.  Indicators demonstrate that the outcomes are achieved and provide measurable evidence of meeting a goal.

## Developing a survey
1. Surveys are one of the tools that project managers use to get answers for their evaluation questions. 
2. Being able to develop a survey and write survey questions is important because it demonstrates your ability to understand the goals of your project and assess how your stakeholders and users value the project. This helps you determine if you're achieving your quality goals and where you need to make adjustments.

## Survey
1. Surveys are tools you can use to evaluate and measure the quality of a project's process, goal, or deliverable. 
2. Making surveys a part of your quality management plan is one way to help you understand what's working and what's not working.
3. Surveys assess the criteria you want to evaluate and provide you with data that will point out whether you've met your quality standards. 


## Survey Development Process
1. Develop evaluation questions.
2. Define your evaluation indicator.
3.  what type of survey to design and questions to ask

## Evaluation question
An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness of your project or program.

## Survey question
