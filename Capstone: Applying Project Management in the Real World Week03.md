## Introduction: Maintaining quality
1. Practice defining quality standards for your project. 
2. Evaluate how successfully the project's standards are being met
3. Present your findings to stakeholders.
4. You'll also create a retrospective document, which project managers use during discussions about project progress, and any process improvements that need to be made. 


## Quality Planning
Quality planning refers to the process that the project manager or the team establishes and follows for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole and how to satisfy them. We can't just launch a project and assume everything will be okay.

Remember, as a project manager, you're responsible for the planning and execution of the project, as well as for the successful completion of the project.

## Quality management
quality management plan on 
1. Quality standards
2. Evaluation questions
3. Feedback surveys 

## Quality Managment benefits
Some of these benefits include 
1. Delivering a quality product
2. Decreasing overhead -- Less error save client money
3. Increasing collaboration and ongoing reviews

## Quality Managment Concepts
1. Quality Planning
2. Quality Standard : which are the requirements, specifications, or guidelines that could be used to ensure the materials, products, processes, and services are fit for achieving a desired outcome
3. Quality Assurance : which is a review process that evaluates whether your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product
4. Quality Control : Quality control refers to the techniques that are used to ensure quality standards are maintained when a problem is identified

## Quality Managment Plan
1. Documents all the information needed to effectively manage quality throughout the project life cycle. 
2. The quality management plan defines the policies, processes, and criteria for project quality, as well as the roles and responsibilities for carrying them out.

## Defining quality standards

## Quality
Quality means making sure that you deliver what you say you will and that you do so as efficiently as you can.

## Quality standards
Quality standards are the requirements and specifications that your product or service must meet in order to be considered successful by your organization and the customer.

## Resources to Consult
1. Project Document : Business Case + Project Charter
2. Conversations with experts and stakeholders
3. You can do some industry research.

For example, software and construction industries have established quality standards related to 
1. Functionality
2. Design
3. Safety
4. Productivity
5. Effectiveness
6. Customer satisfaction

It's important that your standards are objective and measurable so you can clearly identify that the standard has been met. 

## Creating evaluation questions

## Quality Assurance
Remember, quality assurance consists of reviewing processes to evaluate whether or not your project is delivering an acceptable level of quality. 

## Evaluation
Evaluation involves observing, measuring, and then comparing your findings to a set of agreed upon criteria.

## Examples of quality assurance are 
1. Beta testing
2. Internal checklists
3. Feedback surveys

Evaluation is a form of research designed to promote learning and inform decisions. 

## Reason to use Evaluation 
1. To Improve
2. To Judge
3. To Learn

## Evaluation Process
1. Determin the reason of evaluating
2. Write out your evaluation questions. 

## Evaluation Question 
An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness of your project or program. 

There are two main categories of evaluation questions: 
1. Questions that ask how you can make improvements
2. Questions that help you measure and compare. 

## Questions that ask how you can make improvements
1. How can we improve? 
2. What is working?
3. what's not working? 
4. Which goals are being met? 
5. Who is benefiting? 
6. What are the most common participant reactions? 


## Write out your evaluation questions. 
1. What were the results?
2. Were there unintended outcomes? 
3. What were the costs and benefits? 
4. Are there any lessons to be learned?
5. Should we continue?

## Effective Evaluation Question
1. They address stakeholder or user values, interests, and concerns; 
2. They relate to the purpose of the project and of evaluation, they're worth answering and are important for the project and beyond;
3. They're practical and feasible to answer with available resources. 

## Determining evaluation indicators
1. Evaluation indicators reveal the specific type of data that needs to be collected to help you answer your evaluation questions.
 
2. Similar to the way quality standards add specificity to your deliverables and goals, evaluation indicators take your evaluation question and determine the specific type of response you're aiming for.
3.  Another way to think of indicators is that they provide pathways for answering your evaluation questions.
4.  Indicators demonstrate that the outcomes are achieved and provide measurable evidence of meeting a goal.

## Developing a survey
1. Surveys are one of the tools that project managers use to get answers for their evaluation questions. 
2. Being able to develop a survey and write survey questions is important because it demonstrates your ability to understand the goals of your project and assess how your stakeholders and users value the project. This helps you determine if you're achieving your quality goals and where you need to make adjustments.

## Survey
1. Surveys are tools you can use to evaluate and measure the quality of a project's process, goal, or deliverable. 
2. Making surveys a part of your quality management plan is one way to help you understand what's working and what's not working.
3. Surveys assess the criteria you want to evaluate and provide you with data that will point out whether you've met your quality standards. 


## Survey Development Process
1. Develop evaluation questions.
2. Define your evaluation indicator.
3.  what type of survey to design and questions to ask

## Evaluation question
An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness of your project or program.

## Survey question
Survey question is designed to collect data, which can help you answer your evaluation questions.

There are two different types of survey questions you can ask, open-ended and closed-ended questions. 

## Open Ended Questions
Open-ended questions require more than one-word answers, such as yes or no.
 
## Closed-ended questions
Closed-ended questions can be answered with a single response, like yes or no or true or false or selecting a single answer from a list. 
like , ture/false or Yes / No , Multiple choices , Scaled question A sample scaled question might be "On a scale of one to five,

## Tips
1. First and foremost, make sure your questions are asking what you mean to ask.
2.  Each question should be specific and address only one measurable aspect. 
3.  Be careful not to make assumptions about your respondents.
4.   make sure that your questions don't provide too much detail or information. 

## Delivering an evaluation presentation

A.  Start out by considering your audience. 
1. Think about what's most meaningful to them,
2. as well as how much time they have. 

B. In some cases, you'll need to present the same data in different ways.

C. After you've considered your audience, you should create a detailed evaluation report that addresses your evaluation questions.

## two common reporting styles include 
1. a summary sheet 
2. a slide-based presentation.

## Filtering and analyzing
By filtering and analyzing, you become familiar with the results, the respondents, and what those results mean in regards to project quality.
ou need to conduct additional analysis that explains the data. Your job is to figure out what the data means and explain how the data answers your evaluation questions. 
A good way to start analyzing data to present is to look for trends, patterns, and anomalies. 
 
 ## narrative
 After you've analyzed your data and know how you'd like to present it, shape the story of your findings by tying it all together into one cohesive narrative.
 
 ## Storytelling
 Storytelling is the process of turning facts into narrative to communicate something to your audience.
 
 ### Evaluation presentations: Components and tips
In a prior activity, you created survey questions for your evaluation. Once you've administered your survey and collected all the data for your evaluation, you'll have all the information you need to prepare an evaluation presentation. An evaluation presentation examines how well your project is working according to an identified set of standards. .

## What to include in your evaluation presentation
## Introduction
The introduction serves as a summary of your presentation and includes an overview of the project’s goals and desired outcomes. It should include a summary of your findings, lessons learned, and recommendations moving forward. This is a very important section of your presentation, but keep it brief. Your introduction should be no more than a paragraph and only include the most necessary information.  

## What is being evaluated and why
Here is where you will state the purpose of the evaluation. Remember, in the context of project quality management, the purpose of evaluation is to measure how well your project is meeting the established quality standards. Presenting evaluation findings to your stakeholders shows them how well the project is meeting quality standards and informs them of the project’s success. To do this:

1. State the goal, milestone, or deliverable that is being evaluated and the quality standards that were defined for that aspect of the project.
2. Include the evaluation questions and indicators that were used to evaluate each quality standard. 

Pro tip: Remember, your stakeholders have limited time. When preparing your presentation, only select the most important standards and questions.	

## Evaluation findings
Now it’s time to state your findings. Give each standard its own section within this portion of the presentation, and summarize what the findings mean for each standard. Make a clear judgement about the findings: What did you learn? What can you take away from the data? Tell the story of what the data means for the future of the project and for the stakeholders.

Example: "The data reveals that 36% of users felt their dining experience was negatively impacted by the tablets." It’s up to you to synthesize that data and determine why that might be. Maybe it’s because the tablet software wasn’t installed properly, resulting in glitchy technology. Or maybe it’s because the staff wasn’t trained effectively, and therefore the ordering process was seriously delayed. Maybe some customers just don’t want tablets taking their orders, and they prefer to deal with wait staff. Explain what the data means in a way that allows stakeholders to make decisions or declare this aspect of the project successful or not.

## Conclusion with recommendations
In your conclusion, state your findings again and propose a couple of recommendations for how to apply the findings to the next phase of the project. You can also outline how these findings may be used in future projects. 

## How to format your presentation 
Slide-based presentations can be created using digital applications like Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint. This type of presentation uses images and succinct bullet points to provide the necessary information to stakeholders. Slide-based presentations typically include summarized information rather than lengthy, in-depth paragraphs. They are great tools for high-level presentations, when your stakeholders do not need to know every single project detail. 

## Additional tips
## Tailor communications to stakeholders: 
When it comes to communicating important milestones to stakeholders, consider whom you are presenting to. Tailor your presentation to your audience in a way that they will understand and enjoy.

## Start with an interesting hook: 
Begin your presentation with an ice breaker, joke, or an interesting visual aid to get your stakeholders’ attention right away. 

## Use visuals throughout your presentation: 
The use of visuals creates interest and keeps the audience engaged in your presentation. 

## The value of retrospectives
A retrospective, sometimes referred to as a retro, is a workshop or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a project. 

Though retrospectives often happen at the very end of a project, they're also a helpful process improvement tool that can and should be used throughout the project life cycle, especially after reaching a project milestone.

A retrospective gives you a chance to discuss project successes and setbacks and to learn from mistakes. 

## Retrospectives benifits
1. They encourage team building by providing team members with the opportunity to understand different perspectives within the team. 
2. They also facilitate improved collaboration on future projects
3. They promote positive changes in future procedures and processes.

It's project mangar to facilitate a respectful and productive retrospective discussion that recognizes successes and areas for improvement. 

## Retrospectives: Encouraging participation
 Low participation during a retrospective can prevent a project team from making meaningful process improvements. 

## Technique

1. One technique I use frequently to encourage participation is to create a safe environment for the team.
To create a safe environment, you might open the meeting by adopting a policy of what's said here stays here, what's learned here leaves. 
Remind the team that the retrospective is a meeting free from stakeholders or customers, and that it's a safe space where the team can speak directly about problems.


2. To help increase participation, it can also be helpful to model the kind of participation you'd like to elicit from your team. 

3. Another useful technique to encourage participation is to pose a group question and ask for individual responses. For example, you could ask your team members to each think of one success and one challenge from the project so far, then ask each team member to share their responses.

4. Finally, if your team is participating but contributing only very recent successes and challenges, it may be helpful to review the project timeline.

## Retrospectives: Encouraging accountability
Accountability refers to being responsible for decisions associated with a project or task. 

## Accountability Vs Blame
1. Accountability and blame are two very different things, and only accountability belongs in a retrospective.
2. Blame shuts people down instead of empowering them to share honestly. 
3. Accountability doesn't involve assigning blame to specific team members for mistakes.

## Accountability
1. it encourages the team to think holistically (comprehensive) about mistakes and challenges in identify solutions for the future. 
2. Another benefit of accountability is that it encourages ownership. 

## Accountability technique
1. One technique I like to use is to come prepared with specific challenges to discuss is a group.
2. Another useful technique is to turn team complaints into smart action items. You've learned that project goals should be SMART, which means that their specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. But here's another tip, action items could be SMART too.
3. When it comes to encouraging accountability, it's also a good idea to push the team to, identify its role in creating a given challenge. 

## Constructive criticism 
Constructive criticism is a respectful form of feedback that is intended to help the recipient improve a piece of work. 

1. If criticism of a portion of the project begins to go from constructive to unhelpful or harsh, it will be your role as the project manager to redirect the conversation. To change the subject, try to detach the challenge being discussed from any specific person in the room. 

## Retrospectives: Addressing negativity

1.  Before you do your own retrospective, it's important to ask yourself, is this conversation likely to feel stressful for the team? 
2.  Retrospectives are a great way to build trust, honesty, and direct communication with a team.

## To address team negativity
1. To address team negativity, aim to set a positive tone at the start of the meeting, kick off by highlighting project successes. 
2. Determine how you'll set the tone of the meeting.
3. So it might be a good idea to try anticipating (Predict) any potential negativity by meeting one on one with team members before the retrospective happens.

4. If you get the feeling that one team member is likely to bring a negative attitude to the retrospective, try asking yourself a few questions. 
4. 1. Does this person feel insecure about the value they add to this team? 
4. 2. Does this person receive negative feedback on the quality of their work? .


5. To deal with negative participation from an individual team member, consider asking team members individually to share their thoughts. Calling on team members individually does a few things.
6. Finally, you might call a meeting break. A timeout is a great way to help deescalate the situation.
