## Introduction: Maintaining quality
1. Practice defining quality standards for your project. 
2. Evaluate how successfully the project's standards are being met
3. Present your findings to stakeholders.

## Quality Planning
Quality planning refers to the process that the project manager or the team establishes and follows for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole and how to satisfy them. We can't just launch a project and assume everything will be okay.
