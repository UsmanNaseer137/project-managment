## Course 4 : Project Execution: Running the Project
The importance of tracking

Tracking, by definition, is a method of following the progress of a project's activities. 

A deviation is anything that alters your original course of action. Deviations from the project plan can be positive or negative.

Second, tracking helps keep all team members and stakeholders in touch with deadlines and goals. 

Tracking is also crucial for recognizing risks and issues that can derail your progress. 

And finally, tracking helps build confidence that the project is set to be delivered on time, in-scope, and within budget. 

Tracking is important for a few key reasons, like transparency, risk management, and keeping the project on track.
