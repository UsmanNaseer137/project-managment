## Course 4 : Project Execution: Running the Project
The importance of tracking

## Tracking
Tracking, by definition, is a method of following the progress of a project's activities. 

## Deviation
A deviation is anything that alters your original course of action. Deviations from the project plan can be positive or negative.

## Tracking Advantages
1. Tracking makes key project information transparent, and transparency is essential for accurate decision-making.
2. Second, tracking helps keep all team members and stakeholders in touch with deadlines and goals. 
3. Tracking is also crucial for recognizing risks and issues that can derail your progress. 
4. Tacking helps build confidence that the project is set to be delivered on time, in-scope, and within budget. 

Tracking is important for a few key reasons, like transparency, risk management, and keeping the project on track.

## Common items to track
1.  First, you should always track the project schedule. 
2.  Tracking tasks also helps to track your team's progress toward milestones. 
3.  Equally important is tracking the status of action items, key tasks, and activities to ensure that that work is actually getting done. 
4.  Next, you'll also need to track costs to ensure that you don't overspend or underspend on project tasks. 
5.  Finally, you'll need to track key decisions, changes, dependencies, and risks to the project, including any agreed upon scope changes. 


## Different tracking methods
1. Gantt chart
2. Roadmap
3. Burndown chart


## Gantt chart
1. Useful to staying on schedule
2. Useful for projects with many dependencies or tasks or activities or milestones 
3. Large project team

## Roadmap
1. Useful for high-level tracking for large milestone
2. Useful for illustrating how a project should evolve over time.

## Burndown charts
1. Best suited for projects that require a detailed, broken-down review of each task associated with a project.
2. Useful for  projects where finishing on time is the top priority.


If you need to communicate milestones to a large team, you might choose a roadmap. 
If you have a project with multiple dependencies, you might choose a Gantt chart. 
If tracking tasks against your deadline is especially important, then the burndown chart might be your best option. And you may even decide to use more than one.

## Project Status Report
Project status reports improve and simplify communication across teams and keep key stakeholders informed. They also create structure and maintain transparency by making the project status available in a central location. 
Your status report should include:
* A project summary and date 
* Key dates 
* Progress towards milestones (completed and upcoming) 
* Issues and risks, along with their impact and any actions to be taken


## Project Status Report

project status reports are a powerful tool to:
* Improve and simplify communication across the team. 
* Keep everyone, including key stakeholders, informed. 
* Request more resources and support (if needed). 
* Create structure and transparency by recording the project status in a centralized place. 


## Why risks and changes occur
Example of risk:

1. A project risk might be a contractor missing a deadline
2. Introducing a tool that may lead to communication breakdown within your team, or unexpected
3. Additional work because of an unforeseen policy being put in place.

## Change
A change is anything that alters or impacts the tasks, structures, or processes within a project.

## Type of changes
1. New or changing dependencies
2. Changing priorities
3. Capacity and people
4. Limitations on budget or resources
5. Scope creep
6. Fourche majeure —national or international issue


## Identifying and tracking dependencies

## Dependencies
Dependencies are the links that connect one project task to another, and as we mentioned, they're often the greatest source of risk to a project.

## Internal dependencies :
which describes the relationship between two tasks within the same project.

## External dependencies
External dependencies, on the other hand, refer to tasks that are reliant on outside factors, like regulatory agencies or other projects.

## Mandatory dependencies
Mandatory dependencies are tasks that are legally or contractually required.

## Discretionary dependencies 
Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project team. These are dependencies that could occur on their own but the team saw a need to make those dependencies reliant on one another. 

##  Dependency management 
 Dependency management is the process of managing all of these interrelated tasks and resources within the project to ensure that your overall project is completed successfully on time and in budget. 


There are four important steps that a project manager can take: 
1. proper identification
2. recording dependencies
3. continuous monitoring and control
4. and efficient communication. 

## Techniques to help manage risks

## Risk Management
Risk management is the process of identifying potential risks and issues which could impact a project, then evaluating and applying steps to address the effects of the identified risks and issues. 

If you can manage those two things, both changes and dependencies and scope creep, other types of risks become much easier to manage.

## Risk Exposure:
Risk exposure is a way to measure the potential future loss resulting from a specific activity or event. 


## ROAM
## Resolved: 
The issue has been eliminated and no longer poses a problem.

## Owned: 
The issue has been assigned to a team member who will monitor it through to completion.

## Accepted: 
The issue is minor or cannot be resolved, so the team chooses to accept and work around it.

## Mitigated: 
The team has taken action to reduce the impact of the issue (or reduce the likelihood of a risk that has not yet materialized).


## Escalating issues
Escalation is the process of enlisting the help of higher-level project leadership or management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, and validate next steps. 

1. Act as a check and balance
2. Speedy  decision making
3. Reduce frustrations
4. Encourage participation

## Critical problems are issues that may cause 
1. a delay to a major project milestone
2. issues that cause budget overruns
3. issues that can result in the loss of a customer
4. issues that push back the estimated project completion date. 

Trench wars occur when two peers or groups can't seem to come to an agreement, and neither party is willing to give in. 

A bad compromise occurs when two parties settle on a so-called solution, but the end product still suffers. 

## Communicating changes to the team
As a project manager, when communicating a small change that will affect an individual, it's a good idea to send an email. 

When there's a big change within your project that impacts more than one person and is likely to change the budget, deadline, or scope of the project, you'll probably want to have a team meeting. 

## Timeout
A timeout means taking a moment away from the project in order to take a breath, regroup, and adjust the game plan.

## Retrospective
A retrospective focuses on identifying the contributing causes of an incident or pattern of incidents without blaming one individual. 

## Key takeaway
In this example, Sayid maintains a friendly tone, clearly explains the problem and its potential consequences, and makes a clear request of the recipients. The email is also brief and to the point. 
To recap, effective escalation emails apply these five best practices:
* Maintain a friendly tone 
* State your connection to the project 
* Explain the problem 
* Explain the consequences 
* Make a request 
Escalation is a useful skill for solving problems quickly, and sending a strong escalation email that applies these best practices can help get your team the help it needs.

Project Management

## Introduction: Quality management and continuous improvement

## Key quality management concepts

## Quality
Quality is when you fulfill the outlined requirements for the deliverable and meet or exceed the needs or expectations of your customers. 

## Quality Management
1. Quality Standards
2. Quality Planning
3. Quality Assurance
4. Quality Control

## Quality Standards
Quality standards provide requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired outcome.
Like 
Reusability Standards
Reliability Standards



## Quality planning
Quality planning refers specifically to the actions of a project manager or the team to establish and conduct a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are in fact relevant to the project as a whole, and how to satisfy them. 

To steer that discussion, you can ask yourself, 
What outcome do my customers want at the end of this project? 
What does quality look like for them?
How can I meet their expectations? 
How will I determine if the quality measures will lead to project success?


## Quality Assurance
The third concept of quality management is quality assurance. Quality assurance, often shortened to QA, is all about evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product.

## Quality control
Quality control involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results or not. If not, then alternative actions should be taken.
