## Course 4 : Project Execution: Running the Project
The importance of tracking

## Tracking
Tracking, by definition, is a method of following the progress of a project's activities. 

## Deviation
A deviation is anything that alters your original course of action. Deviations from the project plan can be positive or negative.

## Tracking Advantages
1. Tracking makes key project information transparent, and transparency is essential for accurate decision-making.
2. Second, tracking helps keep all team members and stakeholders in touch with deadlines and goals. 
3. Tracking is also crucial for recognizing risks and issues that can derail your progress. 
4. Tacking helps build confidence that the project is set to be delivered on time, in-scope, and within budget. 

Tracking is important for a few key reasons, like transparency, risk management, and keeping the project on track.

## Common items to track
1.  First, you should always track the project schedule. 
2.  Tracking tasks also helps to track your team's progress toward milestones. 
3.  Equally important is tracking the status of action items, key tasks, and activities to ensure that that work is actually getting done. 
4.  Next, you'll also need to track costs to ensure that you don't overspend or underspend on project tasks. 
5.  Finally, you'll need to track key decisions, changes, dependencies, and risks to the project, including any agreed upon scope changes. 


## Different tracking methods
1. Gantt chart
2. Roadmap
3. Burndown chart


## Gantt chart
1. Useful to staying on schedule
2. Useful for projects with many dependencies or tasks or activities or milestones 
3. Large project team

## Roadmap
1. Useful for high-level tracking for large milestone
2. Useful for illustrating how a project should evolve over time.

## Burndown charts
1. Best suited for projects that require a detailed, broken-down review of each task associated with a project.
2. Useful for  projects where finishing on time is the top priority.


If you need to communicate milestones to a large team, you might choose a roadmap. 
If you have a project with multiple dependencies, you might choose a Gantt chart. 
If tracking tasks against your deadline is especially important, then the burndown chart might be your best option. And you may even decide to use more than one.
