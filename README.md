## Course 4 : Project Execution: Running the Project
The importance of tracking

## Tracking
Tracking, by definition, is a method of following the progress of a project's activities. 

## Deviation
A deviation is anything that alters your original course of action. Deviations from the project plan can be positive or negative.

## Tracking Advantages
1. Tracking makes key project information transparent, and transparency is essential for accurate decision-making.
2. Second, tracking helps keep all team members and stakeholders in touch with deadlines and goals. 
3. Tracking is also crucial for recognizing risks and issues that can derail your progress. 
4. Tacking helps build confidence that the project is set to be delivered on time, in-scope, and within budget. 

Tracking is important for a few key reasons, like transparency, risk management, and keeping the project on track.

## Common items to track
1.  First, you should always track the project schedule. 
2.  Tracking tasks also helps to track your team's progress toward milestones. 
3.  Equally important is tracking the status of action items, key tasks, and activities to ensure that that work is actually getting done. 
4.  Next, you'll also need to track costs to ensure that you don't overspend or underspend on project tasks. 
5.  Finally, you'll need to track key decisions, changes, dependencies, and risks to the project, including any agreed upon scope changes. 


## Different tracking methods
1. Gantt chart
2. Roadmap
3. Burndown chart


## Gantt chart
1. Useful to staying on schedule
2. Useful for projects with many dependencies or tasks or activities or milestones 
3. Large project team

## Roadmap
1. Useful for high-level tracking for large milestone
2. Useful for illustrating how a project should evolve over time.

## Burndown charts
1. Best suited for projects that require a detailed, broken-down review of each task associated with a project.
2. Useful for  projects where finishing on time is the top priority.


If you need to communicate milestones to a large team, you might choose a roadmap. 
If you have a project with multiple dependencies, you might choose a Gantt chart. 
If tracking tasks against your deadline is especially important, then the burndown chart might be your best option. And you may even decide to use more than one.

## Project Status Report
Project status reports improve and simplify communication across teams and keep key stakeholders informed. They also create structure and maintain transparency by making the project status available in a central location. 
Your status report should include:
* A project summary and date 
* Key dates 
* Progress towards milestones (completed and upcoming) 
* Issues and risks, along with their impact and any actions to be taken


## Project Status Report

project status reports are a powerful tool to:
* Improve and simplify communication across the team. 
* Keep everyone, including key stakeholders, informed. 
* Request more resources and support (if needed). 
* Create structure and transparency by recording the project status in a centralized place. 


## Why risks and changes occur
Example of risk:

1. A project risk might be a contractor missing a deadline
2. Introducing a tool that may lead to communication breakdown within your team, or unexpected
3. Additional work because of an unforeseen policy being put in place.

## Change
A change is anything that alters or impacts the tasks, structures, or processes within a project.

## Type of changes
1. New or changing dependencies
2. Changing priorities
3. Capacity and people
4. Limitations on budget or resources
5. Scope creep
6. Fourche majeure —national or international issue


## Identifying and tracking dependencies

## Dependencies
Dependencies are the links that connect one project task to another, and as we mentioned, they're often the greatest source of risk to a project.

## Internal dependencies :
which describes the relationship between two tasks within the same project.

## External dependencies
External dependencies, on the other hand, refer to tasks that are reliant on outside factors, like regulatory agencies or other projects.

## Mandatory dependencies
Mandatory dependencies are tasks that are legally or contractually required.

## Discretionary dependencies 
Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project team. These are dependencies that could occur on their own but the team saw a need to make those dependencies reliant on one another. 

##  Dependency management 
 Dependency management is the process of managing all of these interrelated tasks and resources within the project to ensure that your overall project is completed successfully on time and in budget. 


There are four important steps that a project manager can take: 
1. proper identification
2. recording dependencies
3. continuous monitoring and control
4. and efficient communication. 

## Techniques to help manage risks

## Risk Management
Risk management is the process of identifying potential risks and issues which could impact a project, then evaluating and applying steps to address the effects of the identified risks and issues. 

If you can manage those two things, both changes and dependencies and scope creep, other types of risks become much easier to manage.

## Risk Exposure:
Risk exposure is a way to measure the potential future loss resulting from a specific activity or event. 


## ROAM
## Resolved: 
The issue has been eliminated and no longer poses a problem.

## Owned: 
The issue has been assigned to a team member who will monitor it through to completion.

## Accepted: 
The issue is minor or cannot be resolved, so the team chooses to accept and work around it.

## Mitigated: 
The team has taken action to reduce the impact of the issue (or reduce the likelihood of a risk that has not yet materialized).


## Escalating issues
Escalation is the process of enlisting the help of higher-level project leadership or management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, and validate next steps. 

1. Act as a check and balance
2. Speedy  decision making
3. Reduce frustrations
4. Encourage participation

## Critical problems are issues that may cause 
1. a delay to a major project milestone
2. issues that cause budget overruns
3. issues that can result in the loss of a customer
4. issues that push back the estimated project completion date. 

Trench wars occur when two peers or groups can't seem to come to an agreement, and neither party is willing to give in. 

A bad compromise occurs when two parties settle on a so-called solution, but the end product still suffers. 

## Communicating changes to the team
As a project manager, when communicating a small change that will affect an individual, it's a good idea to send an email. 

When there's a big change within your project that impacts more than one person and is likely to change the budget, deadline, or scope of the project, you'll probably want to have a team meeting. 

## Timeout
A timeout means taking a moment away from the project in order to take a breath, regroup, and adjust the game plan.

## Retrospective
A retrospective focuses on identifying the contributing causes of an incident or pattern of incidents without blaming one individual. 

## Key takeaway
In this example, Sayid maintains a friendly tone, clearly explains the problem and its potential consequences, and makes a clear request of the recipients. The email is also brief and to the point. 
To recap, effective escalation emails apply these five best practices:
* Maintain a friendly tone 
* State your connection to the project 
* Explain the problem 
* Explain the consequences 
* Make a request 
Escalation is a useful skill for solving problems quickly, and sending a strong escalation email that applies these best practices can help get your team the help it needs.

Project Management

## Introduction: Quality management and continuous improvement

## Key quality management concepts

## Quality
Quality is when you fulfill the outlined requirements for the deliverable and meet or exceed the needs or expectations of your customers. 

## Quality Management
1. Quality Standards
2. Quality Planning
3. Quality Assurance
4. Quality Control

## Quality Standards
Quality standards provide requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired outcome.
Like 
Reusability Standards
Reliability Standards



## Quality planning
Quality planning refers specifically to the actions of a project manager or the team to establish and conduct a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are in fact relevant to the project as a whole, and how to satisfy them. 

To steer that discussion, you can ask yourself, 
What outcome do my customers want at the end of this project? 
What does quality look like for them?
How can I meet their expectations? 
How will I determine if the quality measures will lead to project success?


## Quality Assurance
The third concept of quality management is quality assurance. Quality assurance, often shortened to QA, is all about evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product.

## Quality control
Quality control involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results or not. If not, then alternative actions should be taken. 




## Fostering customer relationships with communication skills

Using soft skills like negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust building, will help foster a good relationship between you and your customers, and a good project manager knows how and when to apply these skills.

It's important to ask open-ended questions and actively listen to understand the customer's current state versus their desired state and what might help them get from here to there. 
If you ask open-ended questions, you'll find out where you can make your customers feel more secure.

## Exhibiting empathy for your client
1. understanding their frustrations 
2. Addressing them
3. Finding a solution that's beneficial for both of you. 

## Measuring customer satisfaction

## Feedback surveys
Feedback surveys are a survey in which users provide feedback on features of your product that they like or dislike. 

## UAT
UAT, is a test that helps a business make sure that a product or solution works for its users.

## UAT Agenda
1. Welcome your users and thank them for participating.
2. Present the product  i.e present testing guidelines 
3. Start UAT test cases 
4. Walk users via demonstration 
5. Identify Edge cases
  6. Recap your findings, identify bugs or issues, and prioritize which issues need to be addressed first. 

## Critical user journeys.
A critical user journey is a sequence of steps a user follows to accomplish tasks in your product. 

## Edge cases
Edge cases are rare—outliers that the original requirements didn't account for. They deal with the extreme maximums and minimums of parameters. 

## Example
For example, imagine that you created an app that allows for unlimited photo uploads, knowing that users will rarely upload more than 1000 photos in a single session. How will the system deal with someone who actually does upload thousands of photos, or millions, in a single upload? It's unlikely, but it could be disastrous for your software. 

## Ensuring accessibility during feedback collection

## User acceptance testing: Goals, best practices, and management

In the previous video, you learned about different ways to measure customer satisfaction, including feedback surveys and user acceptance testing (UAT). This reading will focus on why conducting UAT is essential to the successful launch of any product, service, or software. We will also discuss some best practices for effective UAT and how to manage the feedback you receive. 
## The goals of UAT
To recap, UAT is testing that helps a business make sure that a product, service, or process works for its users. The main objectives of UAT are to:
* Demonstrate that the product, service, or process is behaving in expected ways in real-world scenarios.  
* Show that the product, service, or process is working  as intended. 
* Identify issues that need to be addressed before considering the project as done. 
UAT simulates real-world conditions, so when the feature works as intended during the testing process, you can be more confident that your product, service, or process will work properly once it is launched. It allows a project team to gather detailed information about how users interact with a product, service, or process. UAT helps the team answer such questions as: Do users recognize its purpose and uses? How do they interact with it? How much time do users take to interact with it? Do they notice all of its features? Is the product, service, or process accessible to everyone? UAT also allows the project team to record information about how users feel about their experience with a product, service, or process. Through testing, the team can learn about the emotions it evokes, identities it conveys, appeal it holds, and so on.
## Best practices for effective UAT
In order to achieve these goals, UAT needs to be conducted thoughtfully. These best practices can help you administer effective UAT: 
* Define and write down your acceptance criteria. 
* Acceptance criteria are pre-established standards or requirements that a product, service, or process must meet. Write down these requirements for each item that you intend to test. For example, if your project is to create a new employee handbook for your small business, you may set acceptance criteria that the handbook must be a digital PDF that is accessible on mobile devices and desktop. 
* Create the test cases for each item that you are testing. 
* A test case is a sequence of steps and its expected results. It usually consists of a series of actions that the user can perform to find out if the product, service, or process behaved the way it was supposed to. Continuing with the employee handbook example, you could create a test case process in which the user would click to download the PDF of the handbook on their mobile device or desktop to ensure that they could access it without issues. 
* Select your users carefully. 
* It is important to choose users who will actually be the end users of the product, service, or process.  
* Write the UAT scripts based on user stories. 
* These scripts will be delivered to the users during the testing process. A user story is an informal, general explanation of a feature written from the perspective of the end user. In our employee handbook example, a user story might be: As a new employee, I want to be able to use the handbook to easily locate the vacation policy and share it with my team via email.  
* Communicate with users and let them know what to expect. 
* If you can prepare users ahead of time, there will be fewer questions, issues, or delays during the testing process. 
* Prepare the testing environment for UAT. 
* Ensure that the users have proper credentials and access, and try out these credentials ahead of time to ensure they work.  
* Provide a step-by-step plan to help guide users through the testing process. 
* It will be helpful for users to have some clear, easy-to-follow instructions that will help focus their attention on the right places. You can create this plan in a digital document or spreadsheet and share with them ahead of time.  
* Compile notes in a single document and record any issues that are discovered. 
* You can create a digital spreadsheet or document that corresponds to your plan. It can have designated areas to track issues for each item that is tested, including the users’ opinions on the severity of each issue. This will help you prioritize fixes.  
## Managing UAT feedback
Users provide feedback after performing UAT. This feedback might include positive comments, bug reports, and change requests. As the project manager, you can address the different types of feedback as follows:
* Bugs or issues: Users might report technical issues, also known as bugs, or other types of issues after performing UAT. You can track and monitor these issues in a spreadsheet or equivalent system and prioritize which issues to fix. For instance, critical issues, such as not being able to access, download, or search the employee handbook, need to be prioritized over non-critical issues, such as feedback on the cover art of the handbook.  
* Change requests: Sometimes the user might suggest minor changes to the product, service, or process after UAT. These types of requests or changes should also be managed and prioritized. Depending on the type and volume of the requests, you may want to share this data with your primary stakeholders, and you may also need to adjust your project timeline to implement these new requests.  
## Key takeaway
User acceptance testing is a powerful tool to ensure that your project outcome is desirable and successful. Be sure to leave time in the schedule for proper testing and issue resolution. 


Project Management


## Continuous improvement and process improvement

## Continuous improvement
Continuous improvement is an ongoing effort to improve products or services. 

Continuous improvement begins with recognizing when processes and tasks need to be created, eliminated, or improved. 

## Process improvement
Process improvement is the practice of identifying, analyzing, and improving existing processes to enhance the performance of your team and to develop best practices or to optimize consumer experiences. 

## Control
A control is an experiment or observation designed to minimize the effects of variables. 

## Data-driven improvement frameworks

Data-driven improvement frameworks are techniques used to make decisions based on actual data. 

## DMAIC
D-M-A-I-C, or DMAIC, stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control, and it maps out five steps that you can take when working toward continuous improvements. 

## PDCA
PDCA is a four-step process that focuses on identifying a problem, fixing that issue, assessing whether the fix was successful, and fine-tuning the final fix.

Plan. Here, you'll identify the issue and root cause and brainstorm solutions to the problem. 
Do, or fix the problem. 
Compare your results to the goal to find out if the problem is fixed.
Act, or fine-tune the fix to ensure continuous improvement. 

## Differentiating projects from programs
A project is one single-focused endeavor
A program is a collection of projects
A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs across the whole organization.
