## Project Exeuction : Week 3
## Introduction: Data-informed decision-making

## Data
Data is a collection of facts or information, and through data analysis, you'll learn how to use data to draw conclusions and make predictions and decisions.

In the same way, as a project manager, you can use data daily to 
-Make better decisions
-Solve problems
-Understand performance
-Improve processes
-Understand your users.

## Common types of project data

## Metric
A metric is a quantifiable measurement that is used to track and assess a business objective. 

## Type of Metric
1. Quality Matrix
2. Productivity Matrix

Productivity metrics allow you to track the effectiveness and efficiency of your project and include metrics like milestones, tasks, projections, and duration.

## MileStone
a milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 

## Task
Project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time. 

## Projection
 A projection is how you predict an outcome based on the information you have now. For example, you can predict that with the resources you have at the start of the project, the project will be completed in six months.

## Duration
The duration of a project is the total time it takes to complete a project from start to finish. Duration can also be used for milestones and determining if you'll meet project deadlines.

## Quality Metrics
Quality metrics relates to achieving acceptable outcomes and can include metrics 
such as the 
1. Number of changes
2. Issues
3. Cost variance

## Changes
Changes show any inconsistencies from the initial requirements of the project.

## Change Log
A change log is a record of all of the notable changes on a project.

## Issue
An issue is a known and real problem that may affect the ability to complete a task. 

## Cost variance
The difference between the actual cost and the budget cost.

##  Discerning important data

## Signal
A signal is an observable change, and it can help you to determine the overall health of your project and identify early signs that something isn't quite right.


## Data ethics

As a project manager, data collection and analysis will be a key part of your projects. As you’ve learned, you’ll collect data from a variety of sources, including focus groups, interviews and questionnaires. The data you collect will usually hold PII (personally identifiable information)—information that could be used to directly identify, contact, or locate an individual. A lot of times, you will also need to report on the data you collect to stakeholders, customers, and your project team. Collecting, analyzing, and sharing this data in an ethical way is extremely important for maintaining the integrity of your organization, your projects, and your position.
Data ethics is the study and evaluation of moral challenges related to data collection and analysis. This includes generating, recording, curating, processing, sharing, and using data in order to come up with ethical solutions.
Businesses apply data ethics practices so they can:
* Comply with regulations 
* Show that they are trustworthy 
* Ensure fair and reasonable data usage 
* Minimize biases 
* Develop a positive public perception 
Data ethics is rooted in several principles. In this reading, we will focus on two of these principles: data privacy and data bias.

## Data privacy
Data privacy is a key part of data ethics. Data privacy deals with the proper handling of data. This includes the purpose of data collection and processing, privacy preferences, the way organizations manage personal data, and the rights of individuals. It focuses on making sure the ways we collect, process, share, archive, and delete data are all in accordance with the law.
As a project manager, it is your responsibility to protect the data you collect. You can help ensure the privacy of data collected from users, stakeholders, and others for your projects by:
## Increasing data privacy awareness. 
Make sure every member of your project team—plus the vendors, contractors, and other stakeholders from outside of your company—are made aware of your organization's data security and privacy protocols. 
## Using security tools. 
Free security tools, like encrypted storage solutions and password managers, can decrease your project’s vulnerability to a data breach. In a lot of applications, like ones that are part of Google Workspace and Microsoft OneDrive, privacy settings can be adjusted to only give access to specific individuals. 
## Anonymizing data.
Data anonymization refers to one or more techniques such as blanking, hashing, or masking personal and identifying information to protect the identities of people included in the data. This helps protect individuals’ personal information by keeping them anonymous. Once the information has been anonymized, it can then be used and shared freely. Types of data that should be anonymized include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, photographs, and account numbers. 


## Data bias (Urdu:Tasab)
Another important data ethics practice is making sure that the data you collect does not indicate any biases. Data bias is a type of error that tends to skew results in a certain direction. Maybe the questions on your survey had a particular slant to influence answers, or maybe your sample group was not fully representative of the population you want to study. Bias can also happen if a sample group lacks inclusivity. For example, if your sample does not include people with disabilities. The way you collect data can also bias a dataset. Say you give people only a short time to answer questions, this can lead to rushed responses. When people are rushed, they tend to make more mistakes, which can affect the quality of their data and create biased outcomes. As a project manager, you have to think about bias and fairness from the moment you start collecting data to the time you present your conclusions. 


## Types of biases 
There are different types of biases to keep in mind when setting up your data collection processes. Here are four of the most common types of biases that could impact your data:
## Sampling bias 
is when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole. For example, maybe your sample did not include people above the age of 65. Or maybe you excluded people from certain socioeconomic groups. 
## Observer bias 
is the tendency for different people to observe things differently. For example, stakeholders from different parts of the world might view the same data differently and draw different conclusions from it.  
## Interpretation bias
is the tendency to always interpret situations that don’t have obvious answers in a strictly positive or negative way, when, in fact there is more than one way to understand the data. Data that does not provide an obvious set of conclusions makes some people feel anxious, which can lead to interpretation bias. For example, a team member might interpret inconclusive survey results negatively, while other team members might be able to think more carefully and assess the data from different angles.  
## Confirmation bias 
is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs. For example, you might ask only specific stakeholders for feedback on parts of your project because you know they are the most likely to have the same perspective as you. 

## Using data analysis to inform decisions

## Data analysis
Data analysis is the process of collecting and organizing information to help draw conclusions. 

## Quantitative data 
Quantitative data includes statistical and numerical facts about the number of rider requests that came in. 

## Qualitative data
The other data is qualitative data, which describes the subjective qualities or things that can't be measured with numerical data, like user feedback about the service or product. 

In an earlier video, you learned that data analysis is the process of collecting and organizing information to help draw conclusions, solve problems, make informed decisions, and support your goals. In this reading, we will go over the key parts of the data analysis process. 

There are six main steps involved in data analysis: Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. Let’s break these down one by one. 

## "Ask"
During the Ask phase, ask key questions to help frame your analysis, starting with: What is the problem? When defining the problem, look at the current state of the business and identify how it is different from the ideal state. Usually, there is an obstacle in the way or something wrong that needs to be fixed.  At this stage, you want to be as specific as possible. You also want to stay focused on the problem itself, not just the symptoms. For example, imagine you are doing data analysis for a gym that is losing memberships. You could ask: Why do we keep losing members? But a better and more specific question would be: What factors are negatively impacting the member experience? That way, when you set off to do your research, you know exactly what to look for. 


Another part of the Ask stage is identifying your stakeholders and understanding their expectations. There can be lots of stakeholders on a project, and each of them can make decisions, influence actions, and weigh in on strategies. Each stakeholder will also have specific goals they want to meet. It is pretty common for a stakeholder to come to you with a problem that needs solving. But before you begin your analysis, you need to be clear about what they are asking of you. For example, if your manager assigns you a project related to analyzing the gym’s business risk, it would be a good idea to confirm whether they want you to analyze all types of risks that could affect the gym or just risks related to weather or seasonal trends.

## "prepare"
After you have a clear direction, it is time to move to the Prepare stage. This is where you collect and store the data you will use for the upcoming analysis process. 

Let’s turn back to our gym membership example. To collect data on the member experience, you decide to send surveys to the gym’s members asking for feedback about their experience. To make sure you get specific answers, you ask them to offer feedback in three distinct categories: upkeep of the facility, customer service, and membership cost. You also leave room for them to write in a response. When you get the member surveys back, it is important that you have an organized system for tracking and filing them.   

## "Process"
This stage is when it is time to Process your data. In this step, you will “clean” your data, which means you will enter your data into a spreadsheet, or another tool of your choice, and eliminate any inconsistencies and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results.  While collecting data, be sure to get rid of any duplicate responses or biased data. This helps you know that any decisions made from the analysis are based on facts and that they are fair and unbiased. For example, if you noticed duplicate responses from a single gym member when sorting through the surveys, you would need to get rid of the copies to be sure your data set is accurate.  

During this stage, it is also important to check the data you prepared to make sure it is complete and correct and that there are no typos or other errors. 

## "analyze"
Now it is time to Analyze. In this stage, you take a close look at your data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and decide on next steps. Here, you will transform and organize the data in a way that highlights the full scope of the results so you can figure out what it all means. You can create visualizations using charts and graphs to determine if there are any trends or patterns within the data or any need for additional research. 

In our gym membership example, let’s say you notice 50% of the members wrote in an additional response on the survey citing that the equipment is outdated. The survey also showed that 75% of the responses cited  “expensive membership fees.” When looking at the 50% of responses citing “outdated equipment” and 75% of responses citing “expensive membership fees” side by side on a graph, you may be able to deduce that these responses inform one another. Members feel like the experience just isn’t worth the price. You might conclude that the gym should invest in new equipment if they want to keep members and add value to the membership fee. 

## "Share"
Once you have asked questions to figure out the problem—then prepared, processed, and analyzed the data—it is time to Share your findings. In this stage, you use data visualization to organize your data in a format that is clear and digestible for your audience. When sharing, you can offer the insights you gained during your analysis to help stakeholders make effective, data-driven decisions for solving the problem. 

## "Act"
And finally, you are ready to Act! In the final stage of your data analysis, the business takes all of the insights you have provided and puts them into action to solve the original business problem. 

Conducting a data analysis is an essential process for understanding a business’ needs and challenges and determining effective solutions. These six foundational steps—ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act—will help set you up for success! 

## Preparation 
Get clear on your goals and the purpose of your presentation.
Be clear and specific about what you want to get out of the meeting, then frame the discussion with that goal in mind. For instance, “We need two engineers who have worked in this industry before,” instead of “We need more resources.” 

##Seek input and set expectations.
Ask your manager or check with stakeholders regarding your presentation goals. Get their input and feedback ahead of time.

If you were invited to present, make sure you understand in advance exactly what the requestor is hoping to gain from your presentation.

## Create a delivery plan.
Identify a headline for each slide, which is the one-sentence main point that you are trying to illustrate with that slide.

Create a couple of supporting points that add interest to the headline, such as anecdotes, charts, data, etc.

Build in signposts. These are ways to clue the audience in to where you are going and what to expect with your presentation.

Limit the number of slides in the main presentation. At the same time, consider creating backup slides for potential challenges, difficult questions, trade-offs, or alternative solutions. You can hide these backup slides at the end of your presentation if you don’t need them, or add them into your presentation if you do.

Be mindful of your audience’s time.
Invite only participants who need to be there.

Send the presentation ahead of time, if possible.

## Develop a strategy for making your presentation memorable.
Use stories and repeat key points. 

Start with a strong intro. Spend extra prep time on the beginning. The beginning is when your nerves are typically the highest, and delivering the introduction successfully can help you quickly gain confidence.

##Practice
Guide your audience through your presentation. 
Help them notice what you notice, and transition between slides by using phrases like “Building on this point . . .” or “As I mentioned before . . .”

## Do a mock presentation with your team.
If there will be more than one presenter, coordinate what each person will cover and how you will manage handoffs.

Practice a question-and-answer (Q&A) session, anticipating the kinds of questions your participants might ask so you are prepared with a quick and confident response. In addition, practice what you will say if you are asked a question that you don’t know the answer to.

Be prepared to run the whole meeting yourself. If a co-presenter fails to show up, are you prepared to step in?

## Schedule time to practice.
Once you’ve outlined what you want to say, practice it—ideally in front of a mirror—or record yourself. This may help you identify awkward phrasing that could be improved and other issues.

## Be prepared for surprises. 
Show that you can adapt and that you know your subject matter. 

If time runs short, can you quickly summarize the key points?

Can you pivot the content according to what is most important to your audience?

## Presentation and pace
Get right to the point. 
Identify what problem you are solving and state it up front.

Tell the audience why you are in the room with them and what you will be covering.

Lay down the ground rules. For example, how do you want to handle questions and comments? Will you take them throughout your presentation or afterwards?

## Check your pace. 
Be mindful of clues from your audience and adjust accordingly.

## Follow up
If appropriate, send a follow up email with summary notes, action items, and time frames.

Debrief with your manager or key audience members on what they heard from the presentation.  Ask them what went well and what could have gone better.

Review next steps.
