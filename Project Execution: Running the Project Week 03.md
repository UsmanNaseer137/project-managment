## Project Exeuction : Week 3
## Introduction: Data-informed decision-making

## Data
Data is a collection of facts or information, and through data analysis, you'll learn how to use data to draw conclusions and make predictions and decisions.

In the same way, as a project manager, you can use data daily to 
-Make better decisions
-Solve problems
-Understand performance
-Improve processes
-Understand your users.

## Common types of project data

## Metric
A metric is a quantifiable measurement that is used to track and assess a business objective. 

## Type of Metric
1. Quality Matrix
2. Productivity Matrix

Productivity metrics allow you to track the effectiveness and efficiency of your project and include metrics like milestones, tasks, projections, and duration.

## MileStone
a milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 

## Task
Project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time. 

## Projection
 A projection is how you predict an outcome based on the information you have now. For example, you can predict that with the resources you have at the start of the project, the project will be completed in six months.

## Duration
The duration of a project is the total time it takes to complete a project from start to finish. Duration can also be used for milestones and determining if you'll meet project deadlines.

## Quality Metrics
Quality metrics relates to achieving acceptable outcomes and can include metrics 
such as the 
1. Number of changes
2. Issues
3. Cost variance

## Changes
Changes show any inconsistencies from the initial requirements of the project.

## Change Log
A change log is a record of all of the notable changes on a project.

## Issue
An issue is a known and real problem that may affect the ability to complete a task. 

## Cost variance
The difference between the actual cost and the budget cost.

##  Discerning important data

## Signal
A signal is an observable change, and it can help you to determine the overall health of your project and identify early signs that something isn't quite right.


## Data ethics

As a project manager, data collection and analysis will be a key part of your projects. As you’ve learned, you’ll collect data from a variety of sources, including focus groups, interviews and questionnaires. The data you collect will usually hold PII (personally identifiable information)—information that could be used to directly identify, contact, or locate an individual. A lot of times, you will also need to report on the data you collect to stakeholders, customers, and your project team. Collecting, analyzing, and sharing this data in an ethical way is extremely important for maintaining the integrity of your organization, your projects, and your position.
Data ethics is the study and evaluation of moral challenges related to data collection and analysis. This includes generating, recording, curating, processing, sharing, and using data in order to come up with ethical solutions.
Businesses apply data ethics practices so they can:
* Comply with regulations 
* Show that they are trustworthy 
* Ensure fair and reasonable data usage 
* Minimize biases 
* Develop a positive public perception 
Data ethics is rooted in several principles. In this reading, we will focus on two of these principles: data privacy and data bias.
