## Project Exeuction : Week 3
## Introduction: Data-informed decision-making

## Data
Data is a collection of facts or information, and through data analysis, you'll learn how to use data to draw conclusions and make predictions and decisions.

In the same way, as a project manager, you can use data daily to 
-Make better decisions
-Solve problems
-Understand performance
-Improve processes
-Understand your users.

## Common types of project data

## Metric
A metric is a quantifiable measurement that is used to track and assess a business objective. 

## Type of Metric
1. Quality Matrix
2. Productivity Matrix

Productivity metrics allow you to track the effectiveness and efficiency of your project and include metrics like milestones, tasks, projections, and duration.

## MileStone
a milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 

## Task
Project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time. 

## Projection
 A projection is how you predict an outcome based on the information you have now. For example, you can predict that with the resources you have at the start of the project, the project will be completed in six months.

## Duration
The duration of a project is the total time it takes to complete a project from start to finish. Duration can also be used for milestones and determining if you'll meet project deadlines.

## Quality Metrics
Quality metrics relates to achieving acceptable outcomes and can include metrics 
such as the 
1. Number of changes
2. Issues
3. Cost variance

## Changes
Changes show any inconsistencies from the initial requirements of the project.

## Change Log
A change log is a record of all of the notable changes on a project.

## Issue
An issue is a known and real problem that may affect the ability to complete a task. 

## Cost variance
The difference between the actual cost and the budget cost.

##  Discerning important data

## Signal
A signal is an observable change, and it can help you to determine the overall health of your project and identify early signs that something isn't quite right.


## Data ethics

As a project manager, data collection and analysis will be a key part of your projects. As you’ve learned, you’ll collect data from a variety of sources, including focus groups, interviews and questionnaires. The data you collect will usually hold PII (personally identifiable information)—information that could be used to directly identify, contact, or locate an individual. A lot of times, you will also need to report on the data you collect to stakeholders, customers, and your project team. Collecting, analyzing, and sharing this data in an ethical way is extremely important for maintaining the integrity of your organization, your projects, and your position.
Data ethics is the study and evaluation of moral challenges related to data collection and analysis. This includes generating, recording, curating, processing, sharing, and using data in order to come up with ethical solutions.
Businesses apply data ethics practices so they can:
* Comply with regulations 
* Show that they are trustworthy 
* Ensure fair and reasonable data usage 
* Minimize biases 
* Develop a positive public perception 
Data ethics is rooted in several principles. In this reading, we will focus on two of these principles: data privacy and data bias.

## Data privacy
Data privacy is a key part of data ethics. Data privacy deals with the proper handling of data. This includes the purpose of data collection and processing, privacy preferences, the way organizations manage personal data, and the rights of individuals. It focuses on making sure the ways we collect, process, share, archive, and delete data are all in accordance with the law.
As a project manager, it is your responsibility to protect the data you collect. You can help ensure the privacy of data collected from users, stakeholders, and others for your projects by:
## Increasing data privacy awareness. 
Make sure every member of your project team—plus the vendors, contractors, and other stakeholders from outside of your company—are made aware of your organization's data security and privacy protocols. 
## Using security tools. 
Free security tools, like encrypted storage solutions and password managers, can decrease your project’s vulnerability to a data breach. In a lot of applications, like ones that are part of Google Workspace and Microsoft OneDrive, privacy settings can be adjusted to only give access to specific individuals. 
## Anonymizing data.
Data anonymization refers to one or more techniques such as blanking, hashing, or masking personal and identifying information to protect the identities of people included in the data. This helps protect individuals’ personal information by keeping them anonymous. Once the information has been anonymized, it can then be used and shared freely. Types of data that should be anonymized include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, photographs, and account numbers. 


## Data bias (Urdu:Tasab)
Another important data ethics practice is making sure that the data you collect does not indicate any biases. Data bias is a type of error that tends to skew results in a certain direction. Maybe the questions on your survey had a particular slant to influence answers, or maybe your sample group was not fully representative of the population you want to study. Bias can also happen if a sample group lacks inclusivity. For example, if your sample does not include people with disabilities. The way you collect data can also bias a dataset. Say you give people only a short time to answer questions, this can lead to rushed responses. When people are rushed, they tend to make more mistakes, which can affect the quality of their data and create biased outcomes. As a project manager, you have to think about bias and fairness from the moment you start collecting data to the time you present your conclusions. 


## Types of biases 
There are different types of biases to keep in mind when setting up your data collection processes. Here are four of the most common types of biases that could impact your data:
## Sampling bias 
is when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole. For example, maybe your sample did not include people above the age of 65. Or maybe you excluded people from certain socioeconomic groups. 
## Observer bias 
is the tendency for different people to observe things differently. For example, stakeholders from different parts of the world might view the same data differently and draw different conclusions from it.  
## Interpretation bias
is the tendency to always interpret situations that don’t have obvious answers in a strictly positive or negative way, when, in fact there is more than one way to understand the data. Data that does not provide an obvious set of conclusions makes some people feel anxious, which can lead to interpretation bias. For example, a team member might interpret inconclusive survey results negatively, while other team members might be able to think more carefully and assess the data from different angles.  
## Confirmation bias 
is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs. For example, you might ask only specific stakeholders for feedback on parts of your project because you know they are the most likely to have the same perspective as you.
