## Introduction: Effective project communication

## Communicating in different ways

## Principles of effective email writing
## State what you want clearly.
--Include your request in the subject line of your email.
--State your request within the first two paragraphs of your email message.
--Indicate the specific call-to-action associated with your request (for example, reply, review, RSVP).
--Write clear, concise sentences when providing details.
--Define terms. Avoid using acronyms and terminology that users may not know. Provide additional information as necessary to avoid misunderstanding. 
## Keep the content short and concise.
--Summarize the content you want to convey, and remove anything in your email that doesn’t contribute to your goal.
--Aim to write “question-less” and “self-standing” emails. This means that the message contains enough information to stand on its own. The reader shouldn’t have any questions about what you want and when you want it.
--Know your audience. Some people—such as executives and other busy leadership—may not want to read emails of more than a few sentences or click on external links for further information. Try to tailor your emails accordingly.
## Structure your writing.
--Use bullets. 
--Use labels. 
--Add hyperlinks.
--Write a strong topic sentence.
## Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
