Project Initiation Phase >> Project Planing Phase
## Introduction: Building out a project plan

## Project Charter
1.Organize vital project information
2.Create a framework for the work that needs to be done
3.Communicate those details to the necessary people.

## Identifying project tasks: Analyzing documentation
1.  you'll learn to analyze project documentation, including documents from previous projects, to identify tasks for a new project.
2.  This documentation includes project charters, emails, and old project plans which a business may have available when you join a new organization or switch to a new project.

## Project Plan
 A project plan is useful for any project, big or small, since it helps you document the scope, tasks, milestones, budget, and overall activities in order to keep the project on track. 
 
## Project Schedule
1. At the center of the project plan is the project schedule. 
2. The schedule is your guide for making time estimates for project tasks, determining milestones, and monitoring the overall progress of the project. 
3. he first thing I do is review the goals and deliverables in the project charter. 
4. Then, I make a list of all the items that have tasks or milestones associated with them.

## MileStone
As a reminder, milestones are important points within the schedule that indicate progress. They usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 


## Project Task
And project tasks refer to activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time. As a reminder, milestones are important points within the schedule that indicate progress. They usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 
For each deliverable, ask yourself: What steps do we need to take in order to achieve this? The steps will become the individual tasks that need to be completed. 


### Tips for defining project tasks
The process of identifying project tasks and defining them is one that requires practice. Breaking tasks down into workable parts is challenging because you have to decide which tasks may require additional subtasks and which tasks do not. For instance, if you are managing a cross-country move, you do not need to break down the task of unloading boxes from the car into which box should be moved first. However, you may need to break down the movers’ tasks into smaller, more detailed steps. As you progress in your career, you will get better at breaking tasks down. In the interim, here are some guidelines to help you improve this very important project management skill. 

Define project tasks in one or two sentences
When writing descriptions of project tasks, keep them to one or two sentences long. If you find that a certain task description needs to be longer than one or two sentences, this indicates that the task is complex and could be broken down into smaller tasks or that it may need further clarification.

Look at project task dependencies
When looking at how you might break certain parts of the project down into tasks, consider task dependencies, or what has to be completed or handed off from one person to another before work on each task can begin. Identifying dependencies can help you decide how much a task needs to be broken down. For instance, if you are managing a project that includes an awards ceremony and one of the tasks is to set up the stage, the dependencies for this task could include getting estimates from an audiovisual (AV) contractor, procuring necessary equipment, and constructing the stage backdrop.

AV contractor estimate  Procuring necessary equipment  Constructing the backdrop  Set up the stage
Enlist help from team members
It is often helpful for your team to be involved in the task breakdown process. You might have a meeting where you discuss each broad goal or major task with the team. This way, team members can present varying perspectives as they work together to break down tasks. For example, if someone on your team has had experience on a similar project, they may suggest a certain task actually be broken down into three different tasks. 

Define project tasks by the amount of time they will take to complete
Defining project tasks by the amount of time they’re expected to take will reveal any especially lengthy tasks. If a task is expected to take a long time, it could indicate that there are additional subtasks that need to be defined. Identifying tasks by time is helpful for scheduling other tasks or events around the longer tasks. This strategy also helps you determine appropriate milestones, as milestones are often the culmination of a series of tasks. Acknowledging the completion of a large and lengthy task is also a great way to celebrate success, learn from the process, and keep the project on track.

Identify project tasks by their “done” factors
Begin with the end in mind: What does it mean for the task to be considered “done”? From there, you can work backwards to see if you’ve missed any steps and identify checkpoints for completion along the way. 


## Identifying project tasks: Conducting online research

## Domain Knowlege
Domain knowledge refers to knowledge of a specific industry, topic, or activity.

Another key to success when working on an unfamiliar project is knowing where to find useful information that can help you increase your domain knowledge. 

Online research can help increase your knowledge of industry terms, techniques, processes, and more, all of which can be helpful is you embark on a new project.

## Tips
1. First, try searching online for news coverage of similar projects at other companies. 
2. It's also helpful to search online for research on topics related to your project. 
3. You could also try researching similar projects in other industries. 
4. Once you've done some initial online research, review the list of tasks that you've identified so far and research the specifics of executing that work. 

## Identifying project tasks: Analyzing key conversations
Discussions with other people working on the project, from stakeholders to team members, can help you uncover tasks that you're still missing or clarify the smaller subtasks. 

## Tips
1.  One way to discover more tasks is to hold a group brainstorm session with team members who will likely work on those tasks. 
2.  Another way to discover tasks is to hold one-on-one conversations with team members about tasks they'll likely be responsible for completing. 
3.  leverage (Get / Purchase /Grip) the expertise of your teammates to discover what you don't know and to fill in gaps in your list of tasks. 
4.   In addition to connecting with teammates to uncover project tasks, it may also be helpful to consult with other people in your organization who are experts on given tasks.
5.    Stakeholders who have high- or medium-level interest or influence in the project are most likely to provide the information you need.

Once you've identified which stakeholders would be most helpful,
1. make sure you're prepared by gathering as much information as possible ahead of your conversation
2. outlining clear outstanding questions that you still need answers to. 
3. present your research and your current list of tasks 
4. explain exactly how they can help you move forward.


Keep in mind that conversations you have about project tasks will often contain more details and information than you need to create a thorough list, but you may want to note some of this extra information since it may be useful later in the project.

The right level of detail to include in your task list will vary from project to project and team to team.

## Ordering tasks and identifying milestones

## Task priority
Determining the proper task order will help you assign start and end dates for each task. When determining priority, first consider the basic order of operations. 

In other words, 
1. what is the natural sequence of tasks? 
2. Are there any dependencies or prerequisites? For example, you can't train staff on how to use the tablets before they've been installed and tested.

## Determine MileStone
1.To determine milestones within your list of tasks, identify points in the project plan where you and your team can evaluate the work completed so far. 
2. Another way to determine milestones is to identify important tasks that your stakeholders have a particular interest in.
3. As you review your list, you should also identify tasks that carry a high risk or signal the completion of a phase or major task. 

## Time estimation: Asking the right questions

Time estimation is a prediction of the total amount of time required to complete a task.

Asking the right questions can help your experts get to the most accurate time estimates possible.

## Strategies for getting accurate time estimates from your task experts. 
1. First, check their understanding of the task. Ask the expert to explain all the detailed steps involved in the task.
2. Next, ask for estimates of the sub-steps and make note of them. Then add them all up and compare that total with the experts estimate of the total time needed to complete the task.
3. Another strategy is to discuss the assumptions the expert might be making when they give you an estimate. For example, what equipment do they assume they'll have? What kind of supplies? How many people do they assume are working on the task? What are their assumptions about the skill and experience level of the people working alongside them on the task?
4. Then ask the task expert to consider how likely it might be that all or some of these assumptions might not work out and how that might impact their estimate. 
5. Finally, another strategy for getting accurate estimates is to compare the expert's estimates against the actual time spent on similar tasks in previous work. 

## Between an effort estimate and a total duration estimate. 
1. An effort estimate only takes into account the actual time it takes to complete a task.
2. A total duration estimate accounts for the effort, estimation, and any other factors, like getting approvals, prep work, testing, and so on.

## Time estimation: Three-point estimating
Three-point estimating is used to help determine the most realistic time estimate for a task. It uses optimistic and pessimistic calculations, meaning calculations based on the best-case and worst-case scenarios. 

## Three Point Estimating
1. Each task receives three time estimates: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic.
2.  Each estimate indicates the projected amount of time a task will take under that category and how likely any potential risks are to occur. 

## optimistic
1. "optimistic" estimate assumes the best-case scenario: Issues will not occur and the task will be completed within the estimated time.
2. In other words, it's how long you hope the task will take, assuming everything goes as planned. 

## Most likely
Most likely estimate is that it is based on how long the task usually takes under normal circumstances, like if the supplies arrive at the expected time and you only need to make some slight adjustments before everything eventually works the way it's supposed to.

## Pessimistic
a "pessimistic" estimate assumes that issues will definitely occur. This is where everything that could go wrong does go wrong.

## Example : The task of training the staff to use the tablets.

### Optimistic  = 4 hour time estimate
1. The task expert tells you that the conditions for an optimistic estimate would mean the vendor who is hired to do training is well-qualified, has all the materials they need, and shows up on time to deliver the training.
2. All of the staff shows up on time and successfully completes the training within the scheduled amount of time.
3. All of the equipment works for the staff to practice on.

## Most Likly  = 6 hour time estimate
1. In a most likely scenario, the task expert assumes that the vendor is qualified but might not have all the necessary materials. 
2. The vendor might be new and need extra time to prepare or take longer to deliver the training.
3. Usually, a couple of staff members can't attend or be on time, so extra training time would need to be scheduled. 
4. here could also be some minor glitches with the equipment and the training might need to be rescheduled for a different day later in the week.

## Pessimistic  6 hours + one additional week
1. Under pessimistic conditions, you could have a situation where the original training vendor quits and a new vendor has to be hired. 
2. There could be several unexpected staff no-shows or turnover right before the training. 
3. Possibly the equipment doesn't get delivered on time or doesn't work, so the training can't happen until the new equipment arrives.


When conducting your own research or having conversations with task experts, be mindful of the three points so that you can determine the outcomes of optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic timing.

## Tips
1. If someone quotes you a time estimate, don't just take their word for it without understanding the context they're estimating from. 
Think about it this way—if someone is being optimistic, they might estimate that a task will only take them two days to complete. If you go with that estimate and it ends up taking a whole week, your schedule is off.

2. But if someone is being pessimistic and quotes one month and the task only takes a week, then you've got extra time in your schedule that could have gone toward other tasks or led to an earlier product release. 
3. Always accounting for a worst-case scenario might seem like a good thing, but it's actually wasteful if you calculate most of your estimates this way.

## Determining a final estimate
1. You want to examine the best- and worst-case scenario timing 
2. Compare these with the most likely scenario.
3. From there, you can build in a buffer that accounts for risks that are likely but still keeps the project progressing at an efficient rate. 


## The three-point estimating technique
Estimating is a crucial aspect of project management. Project managers are expected to accurately estimate essential elements of the project, such as costs, scope, and time. There are many different estimation techniques that can be used, depending on what aspect of the project needs an estimate. Estimation techniques allow project managers to provide better forecasts to stakeholders and clients and more accurately budget the funds and resources they need for project success. 

The three-point estimating technique can be used to help determine the most realistic time estimate for a task. It uses optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely calculations, meaning calculations are based on the “best case” (optimistic), “worst case” (pessimistic), and most probable scenarios. 

## Three-point estimation
In this technique, each task receives three estimates: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic. Each of these three estimates is then associated with the corresponding amount of time that task is expected to take.

## The three-point estimating process
For each task, add a duration estimate in each category: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic. You can get these estimates by doing research on the task or by asking a task expert. As a best practice, add notes about the conditions that determine each estimate.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/163244940-f6c6ceb7-ddd9-48d7-b359-9764ed77d7ce.png)

## Determining a final estimate
To determine your final estimate—the estimate you’re going to use in your project plan—examine the optimistic and pessimistic timing, then compare it with the most likely timing. Consider the conditions that are likely to exist while the task is being completed. Does it seem reasonable that the most likely time can be met? If your team has never completed this task before, or if dependencies for the task are unknown, then the final estimate should be closer to the pessimistic estimate. If your team is familiar with the task and you’re able to confirm the conditions for an optimistic estimate, then the final estimate can be closer to the optimistic estimate. Alternatively, simply use the most likely estimate, especially if the difference between the optimistic and pessimistic estimates is minimal (a few hours or no more than one or two days). A good practice is to build in a “buffer” that accounts for risks that are likely but still keeps the project progressing at an efficient rate.

## Three-point estimation formulas
Some projects will require you to calculate specific numeric values for task time estimates. There are many online resources that provide more instruction for how to calculate estimates, but we’ve provided two popular formulas: the Triangular Distribution and the Beta (PERT) Distribution.

For each formula: E is Estimate (the final estimate you’ll assign to the task), o = optimistic estimate, p = pessimistic estimate, and m = most likely estimate.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/163245020-a2e687e5-f8eb-4e14-a565-53c5972c5e57.png)


## The Triangular Distribution
The weight of each estimate in this equation is identical, which means the most likely case does not affect the final estimate more than the optimistic or pessimistic estimates.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/163245097-fc1295a4-5f74-440e-a5da-1a569378b131.png)


## The Beta (PERT) Distribution
The Beta (PERT) distribution is a weighted average. The most likely estimate receives a multiplier of four, while the overall divisor is increased to six. 

This method takes into account that the most likely case is more likely to occur, so it’s given more weight. The added weight is reflected in the multiplier of four.

Placing more weight on the most likely estimate increases the accuracy of the estimate. In most cases, the Beta (PERT) Distribution has been proven to be more accurate than three-point estimating and is often used to calculate both cost and time estimates.

## Time estimation: Applying confidence level ratings
1. A confidence level rating indicates how confident you are in an estimate's accuracy. 
2. Estimating is not a perfect science, so adding a confidence level rating for a task allows you to address any uncertainty.
3. Knowing the confidence level of your estimate and adding notes about any risks or issues that might affect the estimate can help you identify whether you should ask the project team for their input. They might be able to point out the estimates or tasks you should track more closely.
4. Additionally, if you notice that your confidence is low across a large percentage of task estimates, you might want to communicate your uncertainty about the project timeline to stakeholders.

## Technique
1. Using the three-point technique we just discussed is one way of gaining confidence in your estimates. 
2. Another way to determine a confidence rating is by polling your team about the tasks they're assigned and coming to a consensus about your collective confidence.
3. To do this, you could calculate their level of confidence as a percentage, which means polling everyone on their estimates and calculating the average confidence level.
4. you could define categories for the team. For example, we've never done a project like this before, we've done this once before, we've done this a handful of times, and we've done this a ton of times already. 

Estimating is far from an exact science, particularly in project management when there are so many unknowns. Implementing a system that accounts for those unknowns and ensures an accurate picture of the project timeline means everyone will be better off over the long term.

 Implementing a system that accounts for those unknowns and ensures an accurate picture of project costs means everyone will be better off over the long term.

 
## Time estimation: Effective time estimate negotiation
1.  Negotiation skills can also help you get accurate time and effort estimates, but the skills you use and the approach you take will be a little different. In this case, you're negotiating with a task expert, not a stakeholder. 
2. On any project, you'll have to work with people who have a tendency to over or underestimate time, costs, or resources. People don't do this intentionally.
3. In some situations, using negotiation skills to get accurate time estimates might be critical to the success of the project. There are lots of different negotiation techniques out there, but let's focus on a few that are specific to negotiating a time estimate. 

## Negotiation Techniques
1. say no without saying no; 
2. focus on interests, not positions; 
3. present mutually beneficial options; 
4. insist on objective criteria.

## say no without saying no;
If a task expert gives you a time estimate that's different from what you hoped for, there are a few techniques you can use to try and reach an estimate that works for both of you. Let's start with the first technique: saying no without saying no. 
Instead, ask open-ended questions like: How would you like me to proceed? How can we solve this problem? And, what can I do to help? Questions like these invite the other person to collaborate with you. 


## Focus on interests, not positions.
Focus on interests, not positions. Here, the goal is not to win. Instead, try to identify the other person's interests, their basic needs, wants, and motivations around completing a certain task.

1. You might be working with a task expert who cares deeply about completing the task with a high degree of quality, but you're concerned that if you don't meet the deadline, the quality of the work won't matter. 

## present mutually beneficial options
1. A third technique is to present mutually beneficial options. We covered this a little already, but here's how you can apply this concept when negotiating time estimates.
2. Imagine both you and your task expert want to complete the task as quickly as possible, but the expert's time estimate is still longer than you'd like. Asking some open-ended questions, like the ones listed earlier, can help you figure out if there's a solution that will satisfy both of your goals.
3. You can ask if there are any areas of quality they'd be willing to compromise on that would shorten the schedule estimate but still allow them to complete the task to an acceptable degree.
4. Maybe there's information the expert is missing or a resource that you could commit to finding and supplying to make the estimate lower.

## insist on objective criteria.
1. The last technique is to insist on using objective criteria to define a time estimate.
2. Objective criteria is based on neutral information like market value, research findings, previously-documented experience, or laws and regulations. 
3. The key is to agree in advance about which objective criteria to consult, and then to use the information to determine your estimates. 

## Time estimation: Negotiating with empathy
1. Empathy is the ability to understand and feel what others are feeling. 
2.  Approaching a conversation with empathy can make the discussion much easier. 
3.  Asking questions about how long a task will take could make some people feel insecure.They might feel like you don't trust them, that you think they're not competent, that you believe you know more than they do about their own work, and so on.
4.  Have you ever felt like someone didn't trust you or questioned your ability to complete your work? Even when you're just trying to get a clear understanding of a task you don't understand, asking questions without empathy can leave team members with the sense that you're micromanaging them.

## Micromanaging
6.  Micromanaging is when a manager too closely observes, controls, or continuously reminds the people they're managing of the work they've been assigned.
7.  This has a negative impact because it demonstrates the manager's lack of trust and confidence in the people they oversee. 

 ## There are several ways you can bring empathy to your conversations. 
 1. One way is to listen with curiosity.
 2. Another way to show empathy is to periodically repeat what you think the other person said. 
 3. You can also demonstrate empathy by trying to connect with their experience. Let the person know that you understand that making estimations can be difficult for anyone, yourself included.
 4. Practicing empathy also means you're able to recognize your own judgments. Acknowledge to yourself if you're making internal judgments about the person you're communicating with, like if you're having doubts about their work quality, for example.
 5. Another strategy for practicing empathy is recognizing buffering. A team member might add a buffer to their time estimate for a task without communicating why they added the buffer. 
 6. And finally, in order to effectively employ all of these strategies for practicing empathy in your conversations, you need to be able to fully focus on what the other person is communicating. This means avoiding distractions. Putting your phone on silent, not looking at phone notifications or texting, and closing your laptop are some ways to show the person that you're giving them your undivided attention and that what they're sharing is important to you.
