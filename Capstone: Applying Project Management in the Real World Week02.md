Project Initiation Phase >> Project Planing Phase
## Introduction: Building out a project plan

## Project Charter
1.Organize vital project information
2.Create a framework for the work that needs to be done
3.Communicate those details to the necessary people.

## Identifying project tasks: Analyzing documentation
1.  you'll learn to analyze project documentation, including documents from previous projects, to identify tasks for a new project.
2.  This documentation includes project charters, emails, and old project plans which a business may have available when you join a new organization or switch to a new project.

## Project Plan
 A project plan is useful for any project, big or small, since it helps you document the scope, tasks, milestones, budget, and overall activities in order to keep the project on track. 
 
## Project Schedule
1. At the center of the project plan is the project schedule. 
2. The schedule is your guide for making time estimates for project tasks, determining milestones, and monitoring the overall progress of the project. 
3. he first thing I do is review the goals and deliverables in the project charter. 
4. Then, I make a list of all the items that have tasks or milestones associated with them.

## MileStone
As a reminder, milestones are important points within the schedule that indicate progress. They usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 


## Project Task
And project tasks refer to activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time. As a reminder, milestones are important points within the schedule that indicate progress. They usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 
For each deliverable, ask yourself: What steps do we need to take in order to achieve this? The steps will become the individual tasks that need to be completed. 


### Tips for defining project tasks
The process of identifying project tasks and defining them is one that requires practice. Breaking tasks down into workable parts is challenging because you have to decide which tasks may require additional subtasks and which tasks do not. For instance, if you are managing a cross-country move, you do not need to break down the task of unloading boxes from the car into which box should be moved first. However, you may need to break down the movers’ tasks into smaller, more detailed steps. As you progress in your career, you will get better at breaking tasks down. In the interim, here are some guidelines to help you improve this very important project management skill. 

Define project tasks in one or two sentences
When writing descriptions of project tasks, keep them to one or two sentences long. If you find that a certain task description needs to be longer than one or two sentences, this indicates that the task is complex and could be broken down into smaller tasks or that it may need further clarification.

Look at project task dependencies
When looking at how you might break certain parts of the project down into tasks, consider task dependencies, or what has to be completed or handed off from one person to another before work on each task can begin. Identifying dependencies can help you decide how much a task needs to be broken down. For instance, if you are managing a project that includes an awards ceremony and one of the tasks is to set up the stage, the dependencies for this task could include getting estimates from an audiovisual (AV) contractor, procuring necessary equipment, and constructing the stage backdrop.

AV contractor estimate  Procuring necessary equipment  Constructing the backdrop  Set up the stage
Enlist help from team members
It is often helpful for your team to be involved in the task breakdown process. You might have a meeting where you discuss each broad goal or major task with the team. This way, team members can present varying perspectives as they work together to break down tasks. For example, if someone on your team has had experience on a similar project, they may suggest a certain task actually be broken down into three different tasks. 

Define project tasks by the amount of time they will take to complete
Defining project tasks by the amount of time they’re expected to take will reveal any especially lengthy tasks. If a task is expected to take a long time, it could indicate that there are additional subtasks that need to be defined. Identifying tasks by time is helpful for scheduling other tasks or events around the longer tasks. This strategy also helps you determine appropriate milestones, as milestones are often the culmination of a series of tasks. Acknowledging the completion of a large and lengthy task is also a great way to celebrate success, learn from the process, and keep the project on track.

Identify project tasks by their “done” factors
Begin with the end in mind: What does it mean for the task to be considered “done”? From there, you can work backwards to see if you’ve missed any steps and identify checkpoints for completion along the way. 


## Identifying project tasks: Conducting online research

## Domain Knowlege
Domain knowledge refers to knowledge of a specific industry, topic, or activity.

Another key to success when working on an unfamiliar project is knowing where to find useful information that can help you increase your domain knowledge. 

Online research can help increase your knowledge of industry terms, techniques, processes, and more, all of which can be helpful is you embark on a new project.

## Tips
1. First, try searching online for news coverage of similar projects at other companies. 
2. It's also helpful to search online for research on topics related to your project. 
3. You could also try researching similar projects in other industries. 
4. Once you've done some initial online research, review the list of tasks that you've identified so far and research the specifics of executing that work. 

## Identifying project tasks: Analyzing key conversations
Discussions with other people working on the project, from stakeholders to team members, can help you uncover tasks that you're still missing or clarify the smaller subtasks. 

## Tips
1.  One way to discover more tasks is to hold a group brainstorm session with team members who will likely work on those tasks. 
2.  Another way to discover tasks is to hold one-on-one conversations with team members about tasks they'll likely be responsible for completing. 
3.  leverage (Get / Purchase /Grip) the expertise of your teammates to discover what you don't know and to fill in gaps in your list of tasks. 
4.   In addition to connecting with teammates to uncover project tasks, it may also be helpful to consult with other people in your organization who are experts on given tasks.
5.    Stakeholders who have high- or medium-level interest or influence in the project are most likely to provide the information you need.

Once you've identified which stakeholders would be most helpful,
1. make sure you're prepared by gathering as much information as possible ahead of your conversation
2. outlining clear outstanding questions that you still need answers to. 
3. present your research and your current list of tasks 
4. explain exactly how they can help you move forward.


Keep in mind that conversations you have about project tasks will often contain more details and information than you need to create a thorough list, but you may want to note some of this extra information since it may be useful later in the project.

The right level of detail to include in your task list will vary from project to project and team to team.

## Ordering tasks and identifying milestones

## Task priority
Determining the proper task order will help you assign start and end dates for each task. When determining priority, first consider the basic order of operations. 

In other words, 
1. what is the natural sequence of tasks? 
2. Are there any dependencies or prerequisites? For example, you can't train staff on how to use the tablets before they've been installed and tested.

## Determine MileStone
1.To determine milestones within your list of tasks, identify points in the project plan where you and your team can evaluate the work completed so far. 
2. Another way to determine milestones is to identify important tasks that your stakeholders have a particular interest in.
3. As you review your list, you should also identify tasks that carry a high risk or signal the completion of a phase or major task.
