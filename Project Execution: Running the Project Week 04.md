## The necessity of project teamwork

## Team
A team is a group of people who plan, solve problems, make decisions, and review progress in service of a specific project, or objective. 

## WorkGroup
Teams differ from workgroups, which we define as being based on organizational or managerial hierarchy.Though people within a workgroup might be working toward a common goal, their work is more likely to be coordinated, controlled or assigned by single person or entity.

## Teamwork
Teamwork is an effective collaborative way of working in which each person is committed to and heading toward a shared goal.

## Air Cover
Air cover refers to support for and protection of a team in the face of out-of-scope requests or criticism from leadership. 

## Key takeaway
Providing air cover for your team takes practice. It requires a careful balance of the needs of your stakeholders and the needs of your project team. As you become more experienced in leading projects, you will develop a stronger sense of how to manage nuanced situations like these and provide the air cover your team needs to do their best work. 

## Team development and managing team dynamics
Bruce Tuckman's five stages of team development. 
## Forming
--At this point everything feels shiny and new.
--During this stage, you as a project manager should clarify project goals, roles, and context about the project. 
## Storming
--As people settle into their roles and the work on their project begins, the people on your team are interacting more and maybe disagreeing a bit. 
--This is where feelings of frustration might emerge.
--As the project manager, it's your job to focus on conflict resolution. Listen as the team addresses problems to solve and share insights on how the team might better function as a unit.
## Norming
-- At this point, the team has resolved some of its internal conflict by establishing new norms.
-- project manager should codify the team norms, ensuring that the team is aware of those norms and reinforce them when needed.
## Performing
--The team works together relatively seamlessly to complete tasks, reach milestones and make progress toward the project goal.
--Project manager should focus on delegating, motivating and providing feedback to keep up the team's momentum.
## Adjourning.
-- project is wrapping up
-- time for the team to disband.
-- Celebrate the final milestones and success of the project as a group.

## Team Dynamics
Team dynamics refer to the forces both conscious and unconscious, that impact team behavior and performance.

## Importance of managing team dynamics
-- First, teams have individuals with different skill sets, varying degrees of autonomy, and competing priorities.
-- Create a collaborative and psychologically safe environment.
-- Understanding and managing team dynamics can also help you understand how to motivate your team.
