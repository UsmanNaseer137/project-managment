## Maximizing value-driven delivery

## Value
The term "value" can mean different things for each customer based on what they expect the product to accomplish. 

## Value Delivery
1.  The number one Agile principle is to satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software.  The term "value-driven delivery" means you and your team are focused on delivering a product of high value. 
2.


## How can you make sure your team is focused on value-driven delivery? 
1. Build the right thing
   --  Really understand what your customers want. 
2. Build the thing right
   -- Ensuring that your team only builds the requested or approved features. 
   -- Working on features that aren't necessary can lead to complexities in the product that don't add any value to the users. 
   -- In addition, building more than you need delays or reduces your value upon delivery.
   -- It also increases the risk of bugs or other issues down the road.
4. Run it right.  
   -- Your team has thought through how the user will interact with the product once it's been delivered. 
   --How do users get support?
   --How does the product add value to users long after they initially received it?
   --How do you make sure that new features and capabilities reach the existing users?
   
   
 ## Case study: Forming a value-driven task force
In the previous video, you learned that value-driven delivery is critical to Agile and Scrum project management. In this reading, you will read a case study and analyze how Agile brought value to the organization. 

## Learning from case studies
As you pursue your career in project management, you will come across many resources for learning about other companies and their journeys to becoming Agile. 

Case studies—in-depth, data-driven analyses of a business, community, or organization—are valuable tools for gaining key industry insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors. 

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.
## As you read, ask yourself: 
1. What is the issue?
2. What is the goal of the analysis?
3. What is the context of the problem?
4. What key facts should be considered?
5. What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
6. What would you recommend, and why?

## Value-driven delivery at Sephora
The case study linked below is about how the teams at Sephora, the multinational retailer of personal care and beauty products, created value-driven delivery by forming an Agile task force. 

As the case study details, Sephora’s goal was to develop an organized and efficient process for rolling out customer-centered initiatives. The beauty retailer wanted to maximize their paid media and create custom messaging that was personalized to meet their customers’ needs.

Keep the questions above in mind as you read through the case study. Notice how the various roles and responsibilities were essential to the process and how the company brought people from across the organization together to ideate, test, and analyze. 

When you are finished, think about how Scrum benefitted Sephora and how it improved their overall business model.

## Components of a value roadmap

## Value RoadMap
1. It's an Agile way of mapping out the timelines and requirements for the product development process 
2. Can be used in all types of businesses. 
3. This roadmap is a guide that demonstrates 
   --Where to go
   --How to get there
   --What to accomplish along the way in order to maximize value.
4. Creating a roadmap helps the team explain the vision of the product 
5. Can also be used to identify important milestones.   

## Component of Value Road Map
A typical value roadmap has three components: 
1. a product vision
   --Your product vision is a critical step to starting any new Scrum project. 
   --Your vision is based on your user interviews and market analysis and becomes your team's north star.
   --In other words, it's what guides your team.
   --The product vision defines what the product is, how it supports the customer's business strategy, and who will use it.
3. a product roadmap
   --which the Product Owner is responsible for creating and maintaining.
   --It provides a high-level view of the expected product, its requirements, and an estimated schedule for reaching milestones.
   --It's key to making sure your team is building the right thing.
5.  release plans.
   --The Product Owner and project manager work together to develop these plans. 
   --Product releases occur when the team has developed a basic working version of a given feature or requirement. 
   --A release plan includes the approximate date when the team is expected to release and deliver certain features to the customer or user.

## Release Plan
1. Release Goal
2. List of Backlog items
3. Estimated release date
4. Other relevant dates that impact a release, like a convention or major holiday. 

## Product roadmaps: Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices
As you learned in the previous video, roadmaps are an important part of any long-running project. In this reading, we will summarize the benefits of and best practices for developing a product roadmap, as well as highlight some of the pitfalls you might encounter. 

You may see different types of roadmaps as you continue your project management career. Each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly differently. Here are some of the various types:

Project roadmap

Product roadmap

Value roadmap

Lean roadmap

Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.

## The benefits of developing and maintaining a product roadmap are numerous:

Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 

Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 

Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)

Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

## There are also some pitfalls around roadmaps to avoid:

Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teams’ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.

Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer

Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

## Here are some best practices to help you get the most from your roadmaps:

Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.

Clearly indicate the highest priority items.

If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.

Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 

Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

To learn more about some best practices for building product roadmaps, check out this article: Product Roadmap First Principles

## Key takeaway
Roadmaps are important for any well-managed project, but they are especially useful to Agile teams. Having a shared roadmap about what the team is delivering over a longer time period is an important way to connect the work that the team does on the sprints with the broader vision for the project. This helps the team stay motivated through the rough patches and leads to a great sense of accomplishment as roadmap deliverables are achieved. 

## Creating an effective value roadmap

## Product roadmap
The product roadmap provides a high level view of the expected product, it's requirements and an estimated timeline for reaching milestones. 

## Tips
1. You'll need to ensure that product release dates are only rough estimates. 

## Tips for creating a release plan
1. It's very important that the Product Owner and Project Manager or Scrum Master work together to develop each release plan.
2. This is because the release plans need to connect the product roadmap with the team's capacity and velocity.
3. Factor these into any release plans that might be affected.
4. Scrum Master or Project Manager should always review the release plan before starting a Sprint planning session.

## The capacity and velocity
1. The capacity and velocity is the measure of the team's ability to complete work at a certain pace.
2. Agile principles, which states Agile processes, promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
3. If there are any hard dates or deadlines on your roadmap, meaning a date that cannot change, factor these into any release plans that might be affected.

## Factors resulting in changes to the release plan
1. Team velocity changes
2. Change to product scope
3. Improving the understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain features. 

## Responding to change over following a plan
As we learned in the beginning of this course, Agile dedicates one of its four values to “Responding to change over following a plan.” This reading aims to clarify some important considerations when implementing a change to the release plan.

The best way to think about changing your plan is to break it down into three stages:

1. Identifying a needed change 
2. Deciding to make the change
3. Implementing the change


## Step 1: Identifying a needed change 
First, how do you know if your plan needs to be changed? Here are some aspects of your project that may be candidates for change: scope, time, and costs (or resources). As we previously learned, these are called the “triple constraint,” and they provide a great framework for evaluating change in Agile and traditional projects.

In Agile, scope refers to the contents of the product roadmap, the items in the Product Backlog, the intended deliverables of the project, and the intended users or customers. This is the “what” of the project.

Time refers to the elements of time or layout of the deliverables over a period of time. This could include the product roadmap timeline, release schedule, or even the Sprint duration. This is the “when” of the project.

Costs or resources refer to the makeup of the Development Team, project managers, and product owners, and other “business people” as well as the equipment available to create the deliverable. This is the “how” of the project.

Agile projects are open to change in any of these three areas, and a needed change could be identified by any project stakeholders, including the Product Owner, Project Manager, Scrum Master, or the Development Team themselves. Sources of identified changes could include:

Customer feedback on early prototypes results in new features and some deleted features (scope change)

Sprint Retrospective identifies an area of understaffing (cost or resource change)

Critical project dependencies or deliverable dates have shifted, resulting in a change to the project roadmap (schedule or time change)

## Step 2: Deciding to make the change
Next, how do you decide to actually make the change? There are many decision-making models available to reference. Here are the basic steps involved in most of these models:

Identify the “decider.” It is best to have a single person—generally the Product Owner or a senior stakeholder—in the role of decider to ensure consistency and accountability. 

Develop and share what factors are important to the decision, and gather supporting data that will help the decider make the decision.

Openly discuss the benefits and costs of the decision. Identify areas of uncertainty and capture assumptions.

Document the decision.



## Step 3: Implementing the change
Once changes are approved, it is important to do several things:

Document the change and decision-making process. 
Include meeting notes, pros/cons lists, assumptions, and data that went into making the decision to change the project.

Capture the change in any affected artifacts. 
Update any roadmaps, Product Backlogs, staffing plans, and integration dates, and include a reference to the source of the change so that stakeholders can refer back to it. Consider using revision labels or dates on affected documents like “version 1.2” or “updated on December 20th” so that the team can clearly recognize that the document has changed.

Share the change with all affected stakeholders. 
You can do this through many types of forums: in person at meetings, in documentation and meeting notes, and through email announcements. 

Monitor the change for a certain amount of time. 
This ensures that the team is supportive and aware of the change.

If the change was not approved during the decision stage, you should still document the information and logic used to make the decision. You may even consider putting a change on hold while you wait for more information to make the decision with higher confidence.
   
   
## Facilitating organizational change
I'm going to discuss your role as a project manager in an organization that wants to implement Agile practices. 
Understanding organizational culture and the change management process is crucial when introducing new ways of working.

## Organizational culture 
1.  based on shared workplace values 
2.  Demostrated via  people's behaviors, activities, the way they communicate, and how they work with each other.

## Change management
process of getting folks to adopt a new product, process, or in Agile's case, a new value system.

## Change takes patient persistence.

## Create a sense of ownership
1. find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change you're creating.
2. Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your chances of successfully driving any change in organizational culture. 

## Creating a sense of urgency / Need
1. My favorite approach to this is to ask the team, the organization, and the stakeholders questions about what's working and what's not working right now.
2. Then I ensure the changes relate directly to those opportunities. Here are some questions you could try.
   --What is preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers? 
   --What is allowing our competitors to outperform us in this market? 
   --How can we help our teams become more productive and supported in their work?

##    The influencer change framework
In the previous video, we learned how to apply organizational change management techniques to your team in Agile or Scrum. In this reading, we will learn about the influencer change framework developed by Joseph Grenny, Kerry Patterson, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler in the book INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change, which explores the power of influence in facilitating organizational change. 

## What does it mean to be an influencer? 

These days, when we hear the word influencer, some might think of social media stardom. But being an influencer is bigger than getting “likes”—it is about someone’s ability to lead and influence others to change their behaviors, hearts, and minds to produce meaningful, sustainable results. As a project manager, you will be asked to lead efforts that require this level of change, and applying this model can lead to a big impact.

To influence is different than to persuade. Persuasion is short-term, while influence is lasting. In order to have real influence, you need others to trust you, consider you an authority, and have confidence in your decisions. As a project manager in Agile projects, you may use influence to facilitate organizational change or to get a team to try a new tool, process, or technology. When facilitating organizational change, influence is the difference between temporary changes in behavior and deep change in culture and values.

## Three keys to influence 
The three keys to influence, as researched by the authors of this model, are to clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and use the six sources of influence. Let’s break each of these down.

## Clarify measurable results
You can’t influence others to change until you know what you want, why you want it, and when you want it. You may recall that effective results are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T). When setting goals for a project, remember to ask yourself what the “why” entails. Are the results specific and measurable? Is it what you intended? Is it time-bound? Also, make sure the measures are visible and transparent to the entire team throughout the change.

## Find vital behaviors 
A vital behavior is the action an individual takes at a pivotal moment in the context of the change they are seeking. For example, if a member of the Development Team is seeking to increase involvement of the Product Owner throughout the development process, they might exhibit a vital behavior when they have just finished mocking up a new feature. Instead of just continuing on to the next item on their to-do list, they might send an email to the Product Owner to review their work and provide feedback. By choosing to include or exclude their Product Owner at a pivotal moment, the developer is taking a small action to enact the change they want to create.

As we have discussed, real change happens when you can change the behaviors of others. Whether you are changing the minds of your team, stakeholders, or customers, it is important to track their current behavior patterns and understand the behaviors you need them to adopt in order to make the change you are seeking. 

To determine vital behaviors, you might consult experts, scan the best and most-cited articles and research, or perform a culture assessment by identifying norms and customs within the team. When identifying the behaviors, evaluate which behaviors are constructive to the change you wish to promote and notice examples of those who succeed where most others fail.

## Use the six sources of influence
The authors of INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change studied companies and individuals who were successful or unsuccessful with implementing change, and they identified six sources or factors that were correlated with successful change. When determining how to influence your target audience to create change, you should consider using all of these sources to increase your chances of success. You may even consider prioritizing these based on your knowledge of your audience. For example, some target audiences may be most swayed by financial incentives, while others may be more incentivized by social justice impacts.  

Here are the six sources uncovered by the authors in their research, including a sample idea of how you can use these examples in your work in tandem with our Product Owner involvement scenario (described earlier):  
1. Personal motivation: Are the individuals motivated internally to engage in the new behavior? Can you help them “love what they hate”? Example: Ensure the Product Owner is timely, appreciative, and effective while giving their feedback. 
2. Personal ability: Are the individuals capable of performing the behavior? Do they have the ability, knowledge, and skills to “do what they can't”?
Example: Ensure that the developer knows how to use the available demo tools and can easily send a quick video of the new feature in their email to the Product Owner.
3. Social motivation: Are there social contacts or networks encouraging or discouraging this new behavior? 

Example: Have the Development Team members remind each other in the Daily Scrum to email the Product Owner before they finalize the work.

4. Social ability: Does the team have resources within their social network to help them carry out the new behaviors?Example: Give the Development Team a tool to track all of their demos to the Product Owner during the Sprint. 

5. Structural motivation: Are there rewards or incentives that they will receive if they perform the new behaviors? 

Example: Provide a coffee gift card Sprint award that the Product Owner gets to award after each Sprint.

6. Structural ability: Are there environmental factors at play that either deter or support the new behavior? Can you make the incorrect behavior harder to do than the correct behavior?

Example: Add a rule to the content management system that pre-populates the name of the Product Owner in the reviewer list. 

## Key takeaway
These three keys to influence make up the influencer change framework and will improve your chances of success with a change. Clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and leverage six sources of influence in tandem to lead an organization, team, or an individual to experience positive change. 

## Coaching an Agile team
I'm going to break down your role as a coach into three steps, similar to how you might approach being a coach for a sports team. 
1. First, you'll design the "plays" with the team. 
2. Second, you'll provide feedback to the team. 
3. Lastly, you'll celebrate and learn with the team. 

## Thomas Edison famously said, "I have not failed—I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

## Coaching versus managing in Agile
In the previous video, we learned about the importance of an Agile coach. In this reading, we will further explore the work of a coach and how it differs from that of a manager. 

Both managing and coaching play important roles in project management. The difference in each approach is in communication. Management is about giving direction, while coaching is about teaching. Some situations will call for coaching, and others will call for management. As a project manager, it is important that you understand when each skill set is necessary for success. 

## Managing
So far, we have focused on the responsibilities of project managers. We know that project managers are tasked with delivering a project objective and solving problems as they arise. Project managers keep team members organized and on track. They streamline communication and give directions. This is very indicative of a traditional management approach. At its core, managing requires overseeing the work of others and can include: 

Onboarding and orienting new employees

Conducting meetings

Delegating tasks and assignments

Monitoring progress and performance against those tasks

Making high-level decisions

In Agile project management, however, teams are designed to be self-managing. A self-managing team has the autonomy to choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others from the top down. Agile team members should also feel empowered and equipped to problem-solve on their own.

Even so, there are some cases where the decisive action of a manager is required. Examples include if there is an emergency that needs immediate action, if you are behind on a deadline, or if a client has very specific needs and you are the most familiar with them. In a results-driven project with little room for error, someone needs to step in and take the lead. That is where a managing approach comes in. 

## Coaching 
Although managing seems inherent to project management, coaching is also an important part of the project management role. 

Coaching is a two-way communication style aimed at influencing and developing team members’ skills, motivation, and judgment. Coaching empowers team members to arrive at solutions on their own by teaching them critical thinking and decision-making skills. This is achieved through offering feedback and providing opportunities for professional development. When challenges arise, coaches will offer guidance, then get out of the way. Coaches don’t jump in during times of crisis in a way that a manager would. Coaches ask questions to help team members arrive at conclusions on their own.  

Coaches trust that their team members can make smart decisions, and trust can go a long way. When team members feel trusted, workplace satisfaction increases, and the quality of work improves. 

It is appropriate to use a coaching approach when a team member already has experience working on similar projects and is working on growing new competencies or is trying a new approach for the first time. Coaching is about building confidence and capabilities so that individuals can continuously grow and improve. There are a few principles to keep in mind when coaching: 

Motivate: Coaches motivate team members to take action. They point out the value in others’ work and instill within them a sense of pride in what they do. 

Support: Coaches are an accessible resource for their team to come to when they experience problems or if they have an idea they want their feedback on. 

Encourage and appreciate: When someone on their team is struggling with a heavy workload, a coach will acknowledge and validate the weight of their efforts and assure them that they are capable of handling the challenges ahead.

Coaching is appropriate in many circumstances, especially when you need to build up the confidence of an individual or a team. The most effective leaders strike a healthy balance between managing and coaching based on the needs of the situation, individual, and project they are leading. Examples of where coaching would be helpful include when a team member is branching out into using a new technology or discipline that will turbocharge their career opportunities, when an individual’s behavior is having unintended consequences on the team dynamics that are not readily visible, or if a team is recovering from a setback.

Here’s a scenario where a project manager or Scrum Master should step in to coach a team: Imagine a Scrum team has failed to launch a product that meets the customer needs Sprint after Sprint. The Product Owner continues to communicate to the team that the features are not quite right, and they need to rework the product in the next Sprint or release. The team feels deflated, and they are showing signs of burnout because they keep working on the same three features. Here is a perfect opportunity to do some coaching with the whole team. Consider bringing them together for a working session and cycle through all three principles of coaching:

Motivation: Ask the team to brainstorm positive reasons why the customer is providing this feedback and why it matters to create an excellent end product.  

Support: Work with the team to capture ideas on how to streamline the customer feedback process, such as a design Sprint with the customer in attendance.

Encourage and appreciate: Set up an event where the team celebrates the work they have accomplished so far, and make the event fun and inclusive for all team members.

## Key takeaway 
Managing and coaching are distinct leadership approaches that each yield different results, and both styles require effective communication. A managing style typically utilizes one-way communication to assign tasks and give directives. Coaching relies on open communication in both directions to help develop an employee’s or team’s skills, so they can become self-sufficient. Some team members and company cultures will naturally favor one style over another, but both are necessary leadership skills. As an Agile project manager or Scrum Master, you will use both styles. That said, in Agile and Scrum, a coaching style is usually the best initial option since it will increase the capabilities of the team, leading to more agility over time. 

When deciding which approach to use, ask yourself:  

What is the desired outcome? 

What is the skill level of the team member who has encountered a problem? 

What does the situation need now to reach the desired outcomes?

## Agile team challenges

## Sign of value delivery issues
1. Team has started missing expected delivery dates and is taking a lot longer than usual to complete tasks.
2. You might notice that the team seems burned out, is working long hours, and showing signs of exhaustion.
3. Maybe the team has too many items in progress at any given time
4. Preventing tasks from actually getting to done. 

## Solutions
1. You can try doing more demos of the solutions with the team to ensure they're delivering on the value roadmap.
2. You can also use retrospectives to ask the team if anything is slowing them down, like waiting on dependencies or communication challenges.
3. It can also help to do a quick review with the team and make sure that everyone understands what "done" means. 
4. Finally, be sure to focus on only a few user stories per Sprint. 

## Sign of Business Collaboration issues
1. You might notice that the team is overwhelmed with critical feedback or change requests from business people after they reviewed the working solution. 
2. you might start to detect an "us versus them" mentality between the team doing the work and management.

## Solutions
1. Try addressing critical feedback and change requests by doing more demos.
2. Next, consider conducting a Solution Design Sprint, which is an entire Sprint spent working solely on the solution design.
3. Finally, you can help your team focus by ensuring changes to the Backlog are introduced only in between Sprints.

## Signs of team dynamics and culture issues
1. First is low team morale. If people are super grumpy, irritated, or generally in a bad mood, then you might have some underlying team dynamics issues to sort out.
2. Next, watch out for signs the team is experiencing lots of conflict. If people are arguing a lot and issues aren't getting resolved, the team probably needs some help.
3. Low conflict can also be a sign that the team is experiencing issues.

## Solutions
1. You could run a team brainstorm session about how to work better together. 
2. Another idea is to change up the workflows. Try pairing up people to work together on a hard task or change up the way you run one of your regular meetings. It can 3. Also help to take a training class together or watch a video about team dynamics and discuss it as a group.

## retrospective technique: Six Hats Thinking Technique
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/162268866-78151394-fbea-4c4f-9cc2-cd02688c7741.png)

In this technique, each team member chooses a different hat to explore the subject of the retrospective. The different hats each involve a different objective, like discussing positives or negatives that happened during the Sprint or sharing emotive statements. This helps to ensure that the team takes a well-rounded approach to the retrospective. 

## Common Agile coaching challenges
## Challange 01 Managing a stable product roadmap
Agile projects almost always experience changes in the product roadmap. Being able to respond quickly and productively to these changes is a core Agile value.
But it is possible to have too much change impacting the project, which can lead to an unstable product roadmap. There are two main causes of an unstable product roadmap: 
1. product ambition : Product ambition poses a challenge when product leadership is overly ambitious about what the team can realistically deliver. 
Solutions:
==> First, agree up front how to handle new opportunities, define when they are reviewed and estimated, and how customer or management commitments are made. 
==> Second, set up regular roadmap reviews with the entire team, at least quarterly, so that everyone knows what to expect.
==> And third, promote sharing knowledge between the Product Owner and the Development Team
2. product assumptions.
When there's uncertainty in a project, you may be required to make some assumptions to move things forward. But making too many assumptions can jeopardize (Risk) the team's success. 
Solutions:
==> Document the assumptions and make them transparent.
==> This allows you to discuss the assumptions as a team and either agree that they're safe assumptions to make or decide to question and double check them. If you do decide to double check them, you can use unbiased user research.

## Unbiased user research
--Unbiased user research gathers information about what users really want. 
--It allows you to confirm or reject assumptions 
--Helps you move forward with confidence.

## Challange 02 Incomplete implementation of Scrum
1. First, it can lead to a loss of clear roles and responsibilities
2. Tempted to skip some events or blend them to save time
3. Finally, not providing the team with the Scrum coaching they need

Solutions
-- The solution to all of these challenges is to implement Scrum completely. 

## Challange 03 Experiencing a lack of stability within the team
1. When the team changes a lot, with people leaving and joining frequently, it can make things unpredictable and disrupt the flow of work.

Soultion:
--First, have a quick onboarding process for new team members to help them get to know the rest of the team and understand the project. 
--Second, use a Pair Programming style, where a new team member teams up with a colleague and starts learning on the job. 
-- And third, if team composition changes because members keep leaving, try having shorter Sprints.

## The evolution of Agile
1. One industry report showed that 85 percent of organizations have adopted a product-centric model, which is associated with an Agile approach.
2. Businesses face a lot of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, and they recognize that Agile and the frameworks that derive from it are a way to overcome those challenges.
3. One emerging Agile framework is called DevOps, which combines software development and IT operations.

## DevOps
Our Google Cloud Platform Business defines DevOps as an organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders. 

1. DevOps is about growing and managing teams and organizations that can build and evolve large-scale systems at a rapid pace.   
2. These systems need to be both secure and reliable, so they can better deliver value to customers and organizations.

 ## Business agility
 which involves incorporating Agile principles into the wide sphere of management, so that the organization can thrive in high VUCA environments.
 
 1.  As an Agile project manager in a larger organization, you might find yourself using frameworks like 
-- Scrum of Scrums
-- Scaled Agile Framework, also known as SAFe.

## The relationship between Agile and DevOps
In the last video, we discussed the role of DevOps in Agile at a high level. Many organizations have begun to embrace and employ this approach. We recommend reading about the relationship between traditional Agile frameworks and DevOps in these articles for further understanding:

## Scaling Agile
In the preceding videos, we’ve covered how to run a Scrum team of up to nine team members. But what do you do if your team is larger than that? Or if the size of the product or solution is so large that multiple teams are required to do the work? In this reading, we will explore five frameworks that scale the Agile approach to address the needs of large initiatives or solutions: Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Scrum of Scrums, Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD), and the Spotify Model.

## Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
The most popular scaled framework is the Scaled Agile Framework or SAFe. SAFe is a Lean-Agile scaling framework that draws heavily on concepts from Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), DevOps, and Design Thinking methodologies. SAFe puts the goal of delivering value above all else—the first principle of SAFe is “take an economic view.” The framework organizes all work and teams into “Agile Release Trains” based on value streams; for example, sales. The SAFe framework is mature and provides detailed guidance on all elements of using SAFe, but some elements are more critical than others. Be sure to check back to the Agile principles and values in the manifesto to be sure you are preserving agility. 

SAFe, like most Agile practices, is founded on a set of core values:
1. Alignment: Synchronize the planning and execution of SAFe activities at all levels of the organization. 
2. Built-in Quality: Build quality into all stages of solution development. 
3. Transparency: Make execution activities visible at all levels to build trust among teams and across the organization. 
4. Program Execution: Focus on working systems and business outcomes. 
5. Leadership: Model the values and principles of SAFe. 

## Scrum of Scrums
Scrum of Scrums is a technique for integrating the work of multiple, smaller Scrum teams working on the same project or solution. Coordination among teams is critical to ensuring the deliverables from each team can be integrated into one larger, cohesive deliverable. 

Scrum of Scrums involves the following elements:

1. A group of at least 12 or more people divided into Scrum Teams of five to ten people each 
2. Scrum of Scrums meetings, which are held once a week, twice a week, or daily. These meetings follow the same format as a Daily Scrum meeting but focus on the Scrum team. In these meetings, you’ll discuss questions like: “What did the team do yesterday? What problems occurred, if any, that are negatively affecting your team? What does your team want to accomplish before we meet again? Is your team blocked from moving forward on any tasks?”
3. A Scrum Master or designated “ambassador” for each team that participates in the Scrum of Scrums meetings and a Scrum of Scrums Master who focuses on the overall Scrum process across multiple teams 
4. Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective meetings 


Beyond these very basic guidelines, there is no official framework or methodology to implement Scrum of Scrums. Scrum of Scrums assumes that teams have a good working understanding of Scrum and are able to apply the scaling principles to how they work. Building on this knowledge, they design and iterate their own approach to coordinate multiple teams working on the same product. 


## Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)
Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) is a framework that aims to maximize the Scrum team’s ability to deliver value and reduce waste in larger organizations. LeSS grew out of more than 600 experiments that expanded the practice of Scrum to larger groups. 

LeSS includes ten principles for applying the value, elements, and overall purpose of Scrum across an organization. These principles were designed to create more customer- and collaboration-focused teams. LeSS teams prioritize learning, transparency, and customer needs. The ten LeSS principles are:

Large-scale Scrum is Scrum: Apply the values and principles of Scrum to a larger team. 

Empirical process control: Inspect, adapt, and learn from experience to improve processes. 

Transparency: Ensure clarity and accessibility across a project. 

More with less: Create only necessary processes, roles, artifacts, and waste when scaling. 

Whole-product focus: Think holistically about the product, making sure that all the parts serve the whole.

Customer-centric: Keep the customer’s needs and values at the heart of your process.

Continuous improvement towards perfection: Improve the product—and your process—during every single Sprint. 

Systems thinking: Think about the system as a whole; Don’t get lost in the details. 

Lean thinking: Seek continuous improvement, aim for perfection, and respect people.

Queuing theory: Embrace the Lean principles of “flow,’ manage queue size,” and “minimize multitasking” to keep delivering value. 

The LeSS toolkit provides two frameworks—one for up to about 50 people (called Basic LeSS) and one for 50–6000+ people (called LeSS Huge). More information on the LeSS frameworks can be found at less.works.


## Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)
Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) is a hybrid approach that combines the strategies from various Agile frameworks, including Kanban, LeSS, Lean Development, Extreme Programming, Agile Modeling, and more. DAD guides people through the process-related decisions that frameworks like SAFe and Scrum of Scrums leave open. DAD helps you develop a scaled Agile strategy based on context and desired outcomes. 

DAD is organized into four “layers”:

Foundations discusses the principles, guidelines, Agile concepts, roles and team structure definitions, and Way of Working (WoW).

Disciplined DevOps ensures that solutions are delivered to customers effectively and safely, with data and security management always at the forefront.

Value Streams ensures that solutions are aligned with the organization's business strategy, connecting customers, sales, and portfolio management to the framework.

Disciplined Agile Enterprise (DAE) connects the industry marketplace with corporate governance and larger enterprise activities.

Project managers wishing to implement DAD can read more about the framework in this article: Going Beyond Scrum.


##  The Spotify Model
Another approach you may encounter is the “Spotify Model,” which we discussed in a previous reading. It is important to note that Spotify’s model is not a true Agile framework. There is no standard guide on how to implement it. The model began as a description of how Spotify overcame the challenges of scaling Agile. By focusing their efforts on culture, team autonomy, communication, accountability, and quality, they increased their agility over time. Spotify’s approach has had a huge impact on workflows and team structures across the tech world. Some of the key components include:

Squads: Like Scrum teams, Squads are autonomous teams of 6–12 people working toward the same outcome. All Squads include a coach (similar to a Scrum Master) and a Product Owner.

Tribes: When multiple Squads work on the same feature area, they form a Tribe of 40–150 people. Each Tribe has a Tribe Lead who fosters collaboration and coordination.

Chapters: Squads may be autonomous, but specialists (e.g., JavaScript developers) should still align across an organization. Chapters establish best practices and, where necessary, set standards. 

Guilds: Any group of people interested in a certain topic can form a Guild, where people with shared interests can come together as a community. 

While some organizations have had success with this model, be aware that it evolved from Spotify’s already significant Agile experience. It is the product of extensive introspection and adaptation and draws heavily on the company’s culture of trust, transparency, and autonomy. Therefore, the value of Spotify’s approach to scaling is not in team names like Squads and Tribes but in how they developed practices that supported and served their organizational culture. To learn more about the Spotify Model, check out this video from Henrik Kniberg.

## Best practices for scaling Agile
No matter which framework you choose, it’s important to keep a few basic principles in mind:

Treat scaling models like SAFe, Scrum of Scrums, LeSS, etc., as general frameworks, not instruction manuals. 

Different situations require different solutions. It’s okay to mix and match elements from multiple frameworks, as long as you apply the principles and values of the Agile Manifesto.

Don’t try to scale without prior Agile experience. Going straight from Waterfall to scaled Agile can be risky without a knowledgeable guide.

Finally, and most importantly, don’t scale if it isn’t necessary. The larger your team, the more complex and difficult your project becomes. 

## Key takeaway
Scaling Agile can be as simple as putting two Scrum teams together into a Scrum of Scrums configuration or as sophisticated as training an organization of thousands in the SAFe framework. When you have a large team or a big deliverable that requires multiple workstreams, think about how you can scale to suit your situation. Remember that you can modify SAFe, LeSS, and other scaled frameworks to meet the needs of each project. Make sure your team understands Agile principles before you try to scale since scaling inevitably introduces more waste and complexity.


## Agile project management opportunities

1.  Even if a candidate doesn't have Agile on their resume, one of the first things I ask them is, What's the difference between Agile and Waterfall project management? Their answer usually tells me instantly if they know what Agile is about, and it's a great launching off point for more follow-up questions. 

2.  I want to know whether the candidate knows that Agile is more than just Scrum, Sprints, and Standups. Do they know it's also about founding values that include customer collaboration, value delivery, self-organizing teams? I'm also interested to know whether they make Waterfall out to be the worst solution, or do they know that all projects benefit from certain types of approaches, including Waterfall, like clear requirements, risk management, stakeholder awareness, and more. I also ask, how do you know when to use an Agile approach or framework on your project?

3. Their answer helps me know if they understand how Agile or Scrum can help a project manager with specific challenges and what those challenges are.
4. And finally I ask, if you are facing resistance with your team following a Scrum or Agile practice, how do you convince them to give it a try? Their answer helps me understand how they use communication and influence skills and whether they truly believe that an Agile team can be self-organizing.
5. At Google, our teams sometimes resist being told what to do, especially because this can diminish innovation and creativity, so I always want to hire project managers who work with the team and don't try to force them to do things a particular way.
6.  Some questions you should ask are, how supportive is the management here towards blending project management approaches? What's the first thing I should know about the culture here? And how often will I get to hear about the needs of our users or customers? And what would a typical day look like for me if I were to take on this position?
7. Maybe you're not interviewing for a new role, but you want to bring what you learned in this Agile course back to your team.

8. Here are four things that helped me bring Agile to my teams. First, start small. You may be excited by everything you've learned here, but your team might like things how they are. So introduce Agile practices in bite-sized pieces. Maybe start by using a Kanban board, just to keep track of one workstream, or set up a retrospective after a major milestone. Second, listen to feedback. The most powerful tool a project manager has is the ability to listen to their team and meet them where they are. When you introduce changes, ask the team how it's going. Get their ideas on how to make it better, and include them in your approach. This will amplify your small changes into big results for the team. Third, be strategic.
9. Target your improvements to challenges your team has today—introduce new ways of working that address head on the biggest issues your team's experiencing.
10. You may have setbacks or need to lean on supporters to bring these ideas back to your team.

## Creating a job search plan

A job search plan can help you 
1. establish timelines
2. set expectations, monitor progress
3. adjust as needed to meet your goal of getting a project manager role. 
4. And good news: you can use some of the project management skills you've learned to build out this plan.

## At each stage, you'll gather information to make decisions
1. like the number of resumes you need to send out each week.
2. Your application to interview ratio
3. which types of outreach and cover letter formats are working for you.

Once you have your job search plan in place, it's time to start thinking about the companies and industries that interest and motivate you.
A target company list can be as simple as listing out the companies you think of in a spreadsheet or digital document. 

### Job search project plan
The goal of this reading is to help you take control of your job search timeline and provide you with strategies for advancing your job search process. It will be most useful for people who need to find a job within a certain timeframe and who want to be as effective as possible at every stage of the process. 

This plan will help you design your timeline, set your expectations, monitor your progress, and make adjustments, as necessary, to improve your outcomes. To make the most of these recommendations, plan to put them into action once you have your resume completed and are ready to start actively applying for opportunities. 

Understanding the job search timeline 
The first step in planning your job search timeline is understanding the main factors that influence how it plays out. These factors are: 

1) the time it will take you to apply to the right job (the company that ultimately hires you)

2) the time between the application and the offer

For example, if you estimate that it will take you four weeks to apply for the right job and another three weeks between the application and the offer, you should plan to receive a job offer in seven weeks. 

We’ll begin by discussing how to develop estimates for your job search so you can plan your own timeline accordingly. 

The time it will take to apply to the right job
How long it takes you to apply to the company that you eventually work for depends on how many total roles you need to apply for, and the frequency of your applications. For example, if you determine that you’ll need to apply to 50 roles, you can do this in ten weeks at a rate of five applications per week, or in two weeks at a rate of 25 applications per week. 

It is important to estimate how many total roles you will need to apply for, as this will help you determine how many applications you’ll need to submit every week to reach your goals. To make this estimate, try and ascertain what you expect the following numbers to be, then bring these numbers together for a total number of applications you should plan to submit:

Application-to-first interview success ratio

First interview to second interview success ratio

Success rate of any additional interview rounds (as applicable)

Last interview-to-offer ratio

Here is an example:

If you presume a 20% chance of getting a first interview, a 25% chance of passing the first and second interview rounds, and a 25% chance of getting a job offer after the second interview, then you need to plan on submitting 80 applications to get a job offer.

These are metrics that you can influence. The quality of your application materials will impact how frequently you are invited to a first interview, and your interviewing skills will help you get from one round to the next. 

The time between the application and the offer 
In almost all cases, you will need to apply for the job and complete a series of interviews before receiving an offer. The amount of time that passes between the application and the job offer will depend on how many rounds of interviews there are, and how much time passes between each step. It is important to understand that this timeline is mostly in the control of the employer. Once you submit an application, they will invite you to interview based on their scheduling. For most roles, this process can take between two and four weeks. This can vary by industry, company, and role.

Track your job search
At this point in developing your plan, you should have a clear idea of how long you expect your job search to take. As you progress in your search, we recommend that you record and monitor the accuracy of your initial assumptions about your timeline. This will help you determine whether you are on track to receive your job offer under the timeline you first established, and where in the process you might be able to optimize your performance. Assumptions to track should include:

Application-to-interview success ratio

Success rate of each round of interviews (e.g., how many first interviews led to second interviews)

Number of interview rounds for each company

Tip: It is always a good idea to track details of your job search activities. You’ll gain insight into your success metrics and stay on top of important job search information that might otherwise get lost as your activities progress. You can use a tracker like this one to track your networking activities, application materials, action items, and notes from conversations. 

Next, we’ll discuss how you can improve the efficiency of your job search activities at different points in the process.


Getting interviews
There are a number of steps you can take to increase the number of interview opportunities you receive.

Apply to more jobs
Most people will be invited to interviews somewhere between 5% and 50% of the time. This means that you will need to submit between four and twenty applications to be invited to a single first-round interview. The more applications you submit, the more interview invitations you’ll receive.

Use the recommendations below to ensure that you are earning as many opportunities as possible:

Make sure you are monitoring major job aggregators (engines pulling jobs from multiple sites) such as Indeed and ZipRecruiter. You can set up alerts to receive new postings by email.

Separately track postings on LinkedIn jobs, as they might not be captured by aggregators. 

Identify companies that you’d be interested in working for based on their geographic location or other parameters. Check their career pages directly once or twice a week for new opportunities that might not appear on aggregators.

Make sure you include remote jobs in your search and consider adding other locations if relocation is an option for you.

Monitor local job referral and networking groups on Facebook and other online communities where recruiters and hiring managers share opportunities not posted elsewhere.

Send an email to people in your network, letting them know about your job search and asking them to share relevant opportunities with you. Make it easy for them to help you by explaining what type of role you are looking for and including your resume. 

Optimize your applications
In addition to increasing the number of applications you submit, you can improve the efficacy of each application by optimizing your resume and getting referrals.

First off, make sure your resume follows all the best practices outlined in this reading. 

Next, get feedback on your resume from other people. Recommendations from professionals in your target field are best, but others with experience in hiring can also help. Keep in mind that people might have different preferences, so don’t feel that you need to incorporate every word of feedback you receive. Instead, collect input from multiple people and look for advice that is consistent and makes sense to you. Your goal is to create a resume that is captivating to as many employers as possible! 

Finally, ask for referrals. Referrals are generally the best way to turn more of your applications into interviews. Most companies review employee referrals ahead of other applicants, so, at the very least, a referral increases the chances of your application being properly considered. In addition, employees referring you might be able to provide additional information on the role or the status of your application. 

Before applying for a role, check LinkedIn to see if you, or someone you know, might have a connection at the company. Ask for a referral or an introduction.

Create a list of companies where you know people. Go through each company’s careers page to see if there are relevant open roles for which you can request a referral.

Make sure that everyone you know is aware of your job search, so they can send opportunities your way. Reach out to people directly, post on social media, and mention it in conversations. Remember that opportunities can come from unexpected places such as your barber, book club, church, and more.

Tip: Some companies offer referral bonuses to their employees, so even a stranger might be open to referring you if you are a qualified candidate. Be creative when seeking out referrals, and don’t hesitate to ask.

Passing interviews
The next milestone is getting from one interview round to the next. Companies generally interview multiple candidates at every stage, so it’s to be expected that you won’t always advance to the next round. The good news is that you can increase your interview success rate by practicing and preparing. In the next course, we have an entire lesson focused on interview tips from project and program managers at Google, mock interview practice and more!

Key takeaway
If you’ve followed the strategies laid out in this guide, you should know how to develop a timeline for your job search, monitor your progress, and troubleshoot your applications and interviews to improve your outcomes. 

We encourage you to take the time to record your job search activities—starting with your first application—even if you are not actively trying to establish and maintain a particular timeline. Every application and interview experience is a learning opportunity. Plus, your goals might change over time, and information about your previous applications and interviews will help you analyze your past performance, set realistic expectations for future searches.

Knowing what to expect, and having visibility into what’s actually happening in your job search, is key to being in control of your employment, and landing the job!
