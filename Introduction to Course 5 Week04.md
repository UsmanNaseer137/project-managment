## Maximizing value-driven delivery

## Value
The term "value" can mean different things for each customer based on what they expect the product to accomplish. 

## Value Delivery
1.  The number one Agile principle is to satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software.  The term "value-driven delivery" means you and your team are focused on delivering a product of high value. 
2.


## How can you make sure your team is focused on value-driven delivery? 
1. Build the right thing
   --  Really understand what your customers want. 
2. Build the thing right
   -- Ensuring that your team only builds the requested or approved features. 
   -- Working on features that aren't necessary can lead to complexities in the product that don't add any value to the users. 
   -- In addition, building more than you need delays or reduces your value upon delivery.
   -- It also increases the risk of bugs or other issues down the road.
4. Run it right.  
   -- Your team has thought through how the user will interact with the product once it's been delivered. 
   --How do users get support?
   --How does the product add value to users long after they initially received it?
   --How do you make sure that new features and capabilities reach the existing users?
   
   
 ## Case study: Forming a value-driven task force
In the previous video, you learned that value-driven delivery is critical to Agile and Scrum project management. In this reading, you will read a case study and analyze how Agile brought value to the organization. 

## Learning from case studies
As you pursue your career in project management, you will come across many resources for learning about other companies and their journeys to becoming Agile. 

Case studies—in-depth, data-driven analyses of a business, community, or organization—are valuable tools for gaining key industry insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors. 

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.
## As you read, ask yourself: 
1. What is the issue?
2. What is the goal of the analysis?
3. What is the context of the problem?
4. What key facts should be considered?
5. What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
6. What would you recommend, and why?

## Value-driven delivery at Sephora
The case study linked below is about how the teams at Sephora, the multinational retailer of personal care and beauty products, created value-driven delivery by forming an Agile task force. 

As the case study details, Sephora’s goal was to develop an organized and efficient process for rolling out customer-centered initiatives. The beauty retailer wanted to maximize their paid media and create custom messaging that was personalized to meet their customers’ needs.

Keep the questions above in mind as you read through the case study. Notice how the various roles and responsibilities were essential to the process and how the company brought people from across the organization together to ideate, test, and analyze. 

When you are finished, think about how Scrum benefitted Sephora and how it improved their overall business model.

## Components of a value roadmap

## Value RoadMap
1. It's an Agile way of mapping out the timelines and requirements for the product development process 
2. Can be used in all types of businesses. 
3. This roadmap is a guide that demonstrates 
   --Where to go
   --How to get there
   --What to accomplish along the way in order to maximize value.
4. Creating a roadmap helps the team explain the vision of the product 
5. Can also be used to identify important milestones.   

## Component of Value Road Map
A typical value roadmap has three components: 
1. a product vision
   --Your product vision is a critical step to starting any new Scrum project. 
   --Your vision is based on your user interviews and market analysis and becomes your team's north star.
   --In other words, it's what guides your team.
   --The product vision defines what the product is, how it supports the customer's business strategy, and who will use it.
3. a product roadmap
   --which the Product Owner is responsible for creating and maintaining.
   --It provides a high-level view of the expected product, its requirements, and an estimated schedule for reaching milestones.
   --It's key to making sure your team is building the right thing.
5.  release plans.
   --The Product Owner and project manager work together to develop these plans. 
   --Product releases occur when the team has developed a basic working version of a given feature or requirement. 
   --A release plan includes the approximate date when the team is expected to release and deliver certain features to the customer or user.

## Release Plan
1. Release Goal
2. List of Backlog items
3. Estimated release date
4. Other relevant dates that impact a release, like a convention or major holiday. 

## Product roadmaps: Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices
As you learned in the previous video, roadmaps are an important part of any long-running project. In this reading, we will summarize the benefits of and best practices for developing a product roadmap, as well as highlight some of the pitfalls you might encounter. 

You may see different types of roadmaps as you continue your project management career. Each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly differently. Here are some of the various types:

Project roadmap

Product roadmap

Value roadmap

Lean roadmap

Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.

## The benefits of developing and maintaining a product roadmap are numerous:

Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 

Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 

Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)

Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

## There are also some pitfalls around roadmaps to avoid:

Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teams’ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.

Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer

Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

## Here are some best practices to help you get the most from your roadmaps:

Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.

Clearly indicate the highest priority items.

If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.

Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 

Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

## Key takeaway
Roadmaps are important for any well-managed project, but they are especially useful to Agile teams. Having a shared roadmap about what the team is delivering over a longer time period is an important way to connect the work that the team does on the sprints with the broader vision for the project. This helps the team stay motivated through the rough patches and leads to a great sense of accomplishment as roadmap deliverables are achieved. 

## Creating an effective value roadmap

## Product roadmap
The product roadmap provides a high level view of the expected product, it's requirements and an estimated timeline for reaching milestones. 

## Tips
1. You'll need to ensure that product release dates are only rough estimates. 

## Tips for creating a release plan
1. It's very important that the Product Owner and Project Manager or Scrum Master work together to develop each release plan.
2. This is because the release plans need to connect the product roadmap with the team's capacity and velocity.
3. Factor these into any release plans that might be affected.
4. Scrum Master or Project Manager should always review the release plan before starting a Sprint planning session.

## The capacity and velocity
1. The capacity and velocity is the measure of the team's ability to complete work at a certain pace.
2. Agile principles, which states Agile processes, promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
3. If there are any hard dates or deadlines on your roadmap, meaning a date that cannot change, factor these into any release plans that might be affected.

## Factors resulting in changes to the release plan
1. Team velocity changes
2. Change to product scope
3. Improving the understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain features. 

## Responding to change over following a plan
As we learned in the beginning of this course, Agile dedicates one of its four values to “Responding to change over following a plan.” This reading aims to clarify some important considerations when implementing a change to the release plan.

The best way to think about changing your plan is to break it down into three stages:

1. Identifying a needed change 
2. Deciding to make the change
3. Implementing the change


## Step 1: Identifying a needed change 
First, how do you know if your plan needs to be changed? Here are some aspects of your project that may be candidates for change: scope, time, and costs (or resources). As we previously learned, these are called the “triple constraint,” and they provide a great framework for evaluating change in Agile and traditional projects.

In Agile, scope refers to the contents of the product roadmap, the items in the Product Backlog, the intended deliverables of the project, and the intended users or customers. This is the “what” of the project.

Time refers to the elements of time or layout of the deliverables over a period of time. This could include the product roadmap timeline, release schedule, or even the Sprint duration. This is the “when” of the project.

Costs or resources refer to the makeup of the Development Team, project managers, and product owners, and other “business people” as well as the equipment available to create the deliverable. This is the “how” of the project.

Agile projects are open to change in any of these three areas, and a needed change could be identified by any project stakeholders, including the Product Owner, Project Manager, Scrum Master, or the Development Team themselves. Sources of identified changes could include:

Customer feedback on early prototypes results in new features and some deleted features (scope change)

Sprint Retrospective identifies an area of understaffing (cost or resource change)

Critical project dependencies or deliverable dates have shifted, resulting in a change to the project roadmap (schedule or time change)

## Step 2: Deciding to make the change
Next, how do you decide to actually make the change? There are many decision-making models available to reference. Here are the basic steps involved in most of these models:

Identify the “decider.” It is best to have a single person—generally the Product Owner or a senior stakeholder—in the role of decider to ensure consistency and accountability. 

Develop and share what factors are important to the decision, and gather supporting data that will help the decider make the decision.

Openly discuss the benefits and costs of the decision. Identify areas of uncertainty and capture assumptions.

Document the decision.



## Step 3: Implementing the change
Once changes are approved, it is important to do several things:

Document the change and decision-making process. 
Include meeting notes, pros/cons lists, assumptions, and data that went into making the decision to change the project.

Capture the change in any affected artifacts. 
Update any roadmaps, Product Backlogs, staffing plans, and integration dates, and include a reference to the source of the change so that stakeholders can refer back to it. Consider using revision labels or dates on affected documents like “version 1.2” or “updated on December 20th” so that the team can clearly recognize that the document has changed.

Share the change with all affected stakeholders. 
You can do this through many types of forums: in person at meetings, in documentation and meeting notes, and through email announcements. 

Monitor the change for a certain amount of time. 
This ensures that the team is supportive and aware of the change.

If the change was not approved during the decision stage, you should still document the information and logic used to make the decision. You may even consider putting a change on hold while you wait for more information to make the decision with higher confidence.
   
   
## Facilitating organizational change
I'm going to discuss your role as a project manager in an organization that wants to implement Agile practices. 
Understanding organizational culture and the change management process is crucial when introducing new ways of working.

## Organizational culture 
1.  based on shared workplace values 
2.  Demostrated via  people's behaviors, activities, the way they communicate, and how they work with each other.

## Change management
process of getting folks to adopt a new product, process, or in Agile's case, a new value system.

## Change takes patient persistence.

## Create a sense of ownership
1. find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change you're creating.
2. Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your chances of successfully driving any change in organizational culture. 

## Creating a sense of urgency / Need
1. My favorite approach to this is to ask the team, the organization, and the stakeholders questions about what's working and what's not working right now.
2. Then I ensure the changes relate directly to those opportunities. Here are some questions you could try.
   --What is preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers? 
   --What is allowing our competitors to outperform us in this market? 
   --How can we help our teams become more productive and supported in their work?

##    The influencer change framework
In the previous video, we learned how to apply organizational change management techniques to your team in Agile or Scrum. In this reading, we will learn about the influencer change framework developed by Joseph Grenny, Kerry Patterson, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler in the book INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change, which explores the power of influence in facilitating organizational change. 

## What does it mean to be an influencer? 

These days, when we hear the word influencer, some might think of social media stardom. But being an influencer is bigger than getting “likes”—it is about someone’s ability to lead and influence others to change their behaviors, hearts, and minds to produce meaningful, sustainable results. As a project manager, you will be asked to lead efforts that require this level of change, and applying this model can lead to a big impact.

To influence is different than to persuade. Persuasion is short-term, while influence is lasting. In order to have real influence, you need others to trust you, consider you an authority, and have confidence in your decisions. As a project manager in Agile projects, you may use influence to facilitate organizational change or to get a team to try a new tool, process, or technology. When facilitating organizational change, influence is the difference between temporary changes in behavior and deep change in culture and values.

## Three keys to influence 
The three keys to influence, as researched by the authors of this model, are to clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and use the six sources of influence. Let’s break each of these down.

## Clarify measurable results
You can’t influence others to change until you know what you want, why you want it, and when you want it. You may recall that effective results are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T). When setting goals for a project, remember to ask yourself what the “why” entails. Are the results specific and measurable? Is it what you intended? Is it time-bound? Also, make sure the measures are visible and transparent to the entire team throughout the change.

## Find vital behaviors 
A vital behavior is the action an individual takes at a pivotal moment in the context of the change they are seeking. For example, if a member of the Development Team is seeking to increase involvement of the Product Owner throughout the development process, they might exhibit a vital behavior when they have just finished mocking up a new feature. Instead of just continuing on to the next item on their to-do list, they might send an email to the Product Owner to review their work and provide feedback. By choosing to include or exclude their Product Owner at a pivotal moment, the developer is taking a small action to enact the change they want to create.

As we have discussed, real change happens when you can change the behaviors of others. Whether you are changing the minds of your team, stakeholders, or customers, it is important to track their current behavior patterns and understand the behaviors you need them to adopt in order to make the change you are seeking. 

To determine vital behaviors, you might consult experts, scan the best and most-cited articles and research, or perform a culture assessment by identifying norms and customs within the team. When identifying the behaviors, evaluate which behaviors are constructive to the change you wish to promote and notice examples of those who succeed where most others fail.

## Use the six sources of influence
The authors of INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change studied companies and individuals who were successful or unsuccessful with implementing change, and they identified six sources or factors that were correlated with successful change. When determining how to influence your target audience to create change, you should consider using all of these sources to increase your chances of success. You may even consider prioritizing these based on your knowledge of your audience. For example, some target audiences may be most swayed by financial incentives, while others may be more incentivized by social justice impacts.  

Here are the six sources uncovered by the authors in their research, including a sample idea of how you can use these examples in your work in tandem with our Product Owner involvement scenario (described earlier):  
1. Personal motivation: Are the individuals motivated internally to engage in the new behavior? Can you help them “love what they hate”? Example: Ensure the Product Owner is timely, appreciative, and effective while giving their feedback. 
2. Personal ability: Are the individuals capable of performing the behavior? Do they have the ability, knowledge, and skills to “do what they can't”?
Example: Ensure that the developer knows how to use the available demo tools and can easily send a quick video of the new feature in their email to the Product Owner.
3. Social motivation: Are there social contacts or networks encouraging or discouraging this new behavior? 

Example: Have the Development Team members remind each other in the Daily Scrum to email the Product Owner before they finalize the work.

4. Social ability: Does the team have resources within their social network to help them carry out the new behaviors?Example: Give the Development Team a tool to track all of their demos to the Product Owner during the Sprint. 

5. Structural motivation: Are there rewards or incentives that they will receive if they perform the new behaviors? 

Example: Provide a coffee gift card Sprint award that the Product Owner gets to award after each Sprint.

6. Structural ability: Are there environmental factors at play that either deter or support the new behavior? Can you make the incorrect behavior harder to do than the correct behavior?

Example: Add a rule to the content management system that pre-populates the name of the Product Owner in the reviewer list. 

## Key takeaway
These three keys to influence make up the influencer change framework and will improve your chances of success with a change. Clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and leverage six sources of influence in tandem to lead an organization, team, or an individual to experience positive change. 

## Coaching an Agile team
I'm going to break down your role as a coach into three steps, similar to how you might approach being a coach for a sports team. 
1. First, you'll design the "plays" with the team. 
2. Second, you'll provide feedback to the team. 
3. Lastly, you'll celebrate and learn with the team. 

## Thomas Edison famously said, "I have not failed—I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

## Coaching versus managing in Agile
In the previous video, we learned about the importance of an Agile coach. In this reading, we will further explore the work of a coach and how it differs from that of a manager. 

Both managing and coaching play important roles in project management. The difference in each approach is in communication. Management is about giving direction, while coaching is about teaching. Some situations will call for coaching, and others will call for management. As a project manager, it is important that you understand when each skill set is necessary for success. 

## Managing
So far, we have focused on the responsibilities of project managers. We know that project managers are tasked with delivering a project objective and solving problems as they arise. Project managers keep team members organized and on track. They streamline communication and give directions. This is very indicative of a traditional management approach. At its core, managing requires overseeing the work of others and can include: 

Onboarding and orienting new employees

Conducting meetings

Delegating tasks and assignments

Monitoring progress and performance against those tasks

Making high-level decisions

In Agile project management, however, teams are designed to be self-managing. A self-managing team has the autonomy to choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others from the top down. Agile team members should also feel empowered and equipped to problem-solve on their own.

Even so, there are some cases where the decisive action of a manager is required. Examples include if there is an emergency that needs immediate action, if you are behind on a deadline, or if a client has very specific needs and you are the most familiar with them. In a results-driven project with little room for error, someone needs to step in and take the lead. That is where a managing approach comes in. 

## Coaching 
Although managing seems inherent to project management, coaching is also an important part of the project management role. 

Coaching is a two-way communication style aimed at influencing and developing team members’ skills, motivation, and judgment. Coaching empowers team members to arrive at solutions on their own by teaching them critical thinking and decision-making skills. This is achieved through offering feedback and providing opportunities for professional development. When challenges arise, coaches will offer guidance, then get out of the way. Coaches don’t jump in during times of crisis in a way that a manager would. Coaches ask questions to help team members arrive at conclusions on their own.  

Coaches trust that their team members can make smart decisions, and trust can go a long way. When team members feel trusted, workplace satisfaction increases, and the quality of work improves. 

It is appropriate to use a coaching approach when a team member already has experience working on similar projects and is working on growing new competencies or is trying a new approach for the first time. Coaching is about building confidence and capabilities so that individuals can continuously grow and improve. There are a few principles to keep in mind when coaching: 

Motivate: Coaches motivate team members to take action. They point out the value in others’ work and instill within them a sense of pride in what they do. 

Support: Coaches are an accessible resource for their team to come to when they experience problems or if they have an idea they want their feedback on. 

Encourage and appreciate: When someone on their team is struggling with a heavy workload, a coach will acknowledge and validate the weight of their efforts and assure them that they are capable of handling the challenges ahead.

Coaching is appropriate in many circumstances, especially when you need to build up the confidence of an individual or a team. The most effective leaders strike a healthy balance between managing and coaching based on the needs of the situation, individual, and project they are leading. Examples of where coaching would be helpful include when a team member is branching out into using a new technology or discipline that will turbocharge their career opportunities, when an individual’s behavior is having unintended consequences on the team dynamics that are not readily visible, or if a team is recovering from a setback.

Here’s a scenario where a project manager or Scrum Master should step in to coach a team: Imagine a Scrum team has failed to launch a product that meets the customer needs Sprint after Sprint. The Product Owner continues to communicate to the team that the features are not quite right, and they need to rework the product in the next Sprint or release. The team feels deflated, and they are showing signs of burnout because they keep working on the same three features. Here is a perfect opportunity to do some coaching with the whole team. Consider bringing them together for a working session and cycle through all three principles of coaching:

Motivation: Ask the team to brainstorm positive reasons why the customer is providing this feedback and why it matters to create an excellent end product.  

Support: Work with the team to capture ideas on how to streamline the customer feedback process, such as a design Sprint with the customer in attendance.

Encourage and appreciate: Set up an event where the team celebrates the work they have accomplished so far, and make the event fun and inclusive for all team members.

## Key takeaway 
Managing and coaching are distinct leadership approaches that each yield different results, and both styles require effective communication. A managing style typically utilizes one-way communication to assign tasks and give directives. Coaching relies on open communication in both directions to help develop an employee’s or team’s skills, so they can become self-sufficient. Some team members and company cultures will naturally favor one style over another, but both are necessary leadership skills. As an Agile project manager or Scrum Master, you will use both styles. That said, in Agile and Scrum, a coaching style is usually the best initial option since it will increase the capabilities of the team, leading to more agility over time. 

When deciding which approach to use, ask yourself:  

What is the desired outcome? 

What is the skill level of the team member who has encountered a problem? 

What does the situation need now to reach the desired outcomes?

## Agile team challenges

## Sign of value delivery issues
1. Team has started missing expected delivery dates and is taking a lot longer than usual to complete tasks.
2. You might notice that the team seems burned out, is working long hours, and showing signs of exhaustion.
3. Maybe the team has too many items in progress at any given time
4. Preventing tasks from actually getting to done. 

## Solutions
1. You can try doing more demos of the solutions with the team to ensure they're delivering on the value roadmap.
2. You can also use retrospectives to ask the team if anything is slowing them down, like waiting on dependencies or communication challenges.
3. It can also help to do a quick review with the team and make sure that everyone understands what "done" means. 
4. Finally, be sure to focus on only a few user stories per Sprint. 

## Sign of Business Collaboration issues
1. You might notice that the team is overwhelmed with critical feedback or change requests from business people after they reviewed the working solution. 
2. you might start to detect an "us versus them" mentality between the team doing the work and management.

## Solutions
1. Try addressing critical feedback and change requests by doing more demos.
2. Next, consider conducting a Solution Design Sprint, which is an entire Sprint spent working solely on the solution design.
3. Finally, you can help your team focus by ensuring changes to the Backlog are introduced only in between Sprints.

## Signs of team dynamics and culture issues
1. First is low team morale. If people are super grumpy, irritated, or generally in a bad mood, then you might have some underlying team dynamics issues to sort out.
2. Next, watch out for signs the team is experiencing lots of conflict. If people are arguing a lot and issues aren't getting resolved, the team probably needs some help.
3. Low conflict can also be a sign that the team is experiencing issues.

## Solutions
1. You could run a team brainstorm session about how to work better together. 
2. Another idea is to change up the workflows. Try pairing up people to work together on a hard task or change up the way you run one of your regular meetings. It can 3. Also help to take a training class together or watch a video about team dynamics and discuss it as a group.

## retrospective technique: Six Hats Thinking Technique
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74914096/162268866-78151394-fbea-4c4f-9cc2-cd02688c7741.png)

In this technique, each team member chooses a different hat to explore the subject of the retrospective. The different hats each involve a different objective, like discussing positives or negatives that happened during the Sprint or sharing emotive statements. This helps to ensure that the team takes a well-rounded approach to the retrospective.
